Q2: To solve the expression \( \frac{44}{11} + \frac{110}{44} + \frac{44}{1100} \), we first simplify each fraction individually.

- Simplifying \(\frac{44}{11}\):
  \[
  \frac{44}{11} = 4
  \]

- Simplifying \(\frac{110}{44}\):
  \[
  \frac{110}{44} = \frac{110 \div 22}{44 \div 22} = \frac{5}{2}
  \]

- Simplifying \(\frac{44}{1100}\):
  \[
  \frac{44}{1100} = \frac{44 \div 44}{1100 \div 44} = \frac{1}{25}
  \]

Now, we need to sum these simplified values:
\[
4 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{25}
\]

To add these numbers together, they should be expressed with a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50.

- Converting \(4\) to a fraction with denominator 50:
  \[
  4 = \frac{4 \times 50}{1 \times 50} = \frac{200}{50}
  \]

- Converting \(\frac{5}{2}\) to a fraction with denominator 50:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 25}{2 \times 25} = \frac{125}{50}
  \]

- Converting \(\frac{1}{25}\) to a fraction with denominator 50:
  \[
  \frac{1}{25} = \frac{1 \times 2}{25 \times 2} = \frac{2}{50}
  \]

Now, we sum these fractions:
\[
\frac{200}{50} + \frac{125}{50} + \frac{2}{50} = \frac{200 + 125 + 2}{50} = \frac{327}{50}
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is:
$$
\boxed{\frac{327}{50}}

Q4: To solve this problem, we need to understand when the product of two numbers is a multiple of 6.

A number is a multiple of 6 if and only if it can be expressed in the form \(6k\) where \(k\) is an integer. This means that for the product of two dice rolls to be a multiple of 6, both dice must contribute factors such that their combined product includes at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3.

A standard die has numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The prime factorizations are:
- \(1 = 1\)
- \(2 = 2\)
- \(3 = 3\)
- \(4 = 2^2\)
- \(5 = 5\)
- \(6 = 2 \times 3\)

To get a product that is at least twice and one of the numbers must be at least 3 (to provide an additional factor of 3), or it could simply include both factors within the prime factorization.

Let's list possible sums for different combinations where the product can be a multiple of 6:

- For two dice rolls, \(a\) and \(b\):
    - If one die shows a number with the factor of 2 (like 2, 4, or 6) and another with the factor of 3 (like 3 or 6), their product will be at least a multiple of 6. Examples include (2, 3) -> \(2 \times 3 = 6\), (2, 6) -> \(2 \times 6 = 12\), etc.

Let's calculate the possible sums for valid products:
- For (2, 3): Sum = 5
- For (2, 6): Sum = 8
- For (3, 2): Sum = 5
- For (3, 3): Sum = 6
- For (3, 6): Sum = 9
- For (4, 3): Sum = 7
- For (4, 6): Sum = 10
- For (5, 3): Sum = 8
- For (5, 6): Sum = 11
- For (6, 2): Sum = 8
- For (6, 3): Sum = 9
- For (6, 4): Sum = 10
- For (6, 5): Sum = 11

From the above, we see that the sums are: \(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\) and \(11\). None of these sums include the number 4.

Therefore, the integer that cannot be the sum is \(\boxed{4}\). vs 6 | Current Accuracy: 25.0%

Q9: Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second tank has 1 more guppy than the first tank, so it has \( x + 1 \) guppies.
- The third tank has 2 more guppie than the second tank, thus having \( (x + 1) + 2 = x + 3 \) guppies.
- The fourth tank has 3 more guppies than the third tank, hence having \( (x + 3) + 3 = x + 6 \) guppies.

Now we add up all the guppies in each tank:
\[
x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6)
\]

Simplify this equation:
\[
4x + 10
\]

We are given that the total number of guppies is 90, so we set up the following equation to solve for \( x \):
\[
4x + 10 = 90
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[
4x = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
x = 20
\]

Now, we find the number of guppies in the fourth tank (\( x + 6 \)):
\[
x + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26
\]

Thus, the number of guppies in the fourth tank is **26**. vs 26 | Current Accuracy: 22.2%

Q10: To solve for \( \text{FLYFLY} = \text{BUGBUG} \), we need to find distinct digits that satisfy this equation. The notation suggests that the left side is multiplied by 100 (resulting in 6 digits) and the right side multiplies to 6 digits, which implies \( \text{FLYFLY} \) must be a multiple of 100.

Thus, we can write:
\[
\text{BUGBUG} = (\text{F}\text{L}\text{Y}) \times 100
\]

Let's denote \(\text{FLY} = x\) and thus:
\[
x \times 100 = \text{BUGBUG}
\]

This implies that \(x\) must be a four-digit number (since multiplying by 100 adds three zeros at the end).

Now, we need to find distinct digits for each part. The largest possible value for \(\text{FLY}\) is constrained by its digit composition and multiplication. We can start from the highest distinct digits available: 9, 8, etc., ensuring no digit repeats.

Given the constraints of forming a valid four-digit number with distinct digits, let’s test some plausible candidates:

Let's first try \(\text{FLY} = 975\):
\[
\text{BUGBUG} = 975 \times 100 = 97500
\]

Here, \( \text{BUG} \) must be a three-digit number whose digits form the number 975. Testing possible values for BUG:

If we choose \(\text{B} = 9\), \(\text{U} = 7\), and \(\text{G} = 5\) (all distinct):
- This forms \( \text{BUG} = 975 \).
- Then, multiplying by 100 gives:
  \[
  975 \times 100 = 97500
  \]

Thus, this combination fits the criteria. Therefore:

\[
\text{FLY} + \text{BUG} = 975 + 975 = 1950
\]

The value of \( \text{FLY} + \text{BUG} \) is:
\[
\boxed{1950}

Q12: To determine the least possible value for the fraction representing the number of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection, we need to break down the information provided and perform some calculations.

Firstly, Jordan has 15 pairs of sneakers. Three-fifths of these pairs are red:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ red pairs}
\]
This means that the remaining pairs are white:
\[
15 - 9 = 6 \text{ white pairs}
\]

Next, two-thirds of the sneakers are high-top. To find this number:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10 \text{ high-top sneakers}
\]
And thus, the remaining are low-top:
\[
15 - 10 = 5 \text{ low-top sneakers}
\]

Now, let's look at red and white sneakers in terms of high-top vs. low-top:

For red sneakers:
- Let \( r_{h} \) be the number of red high-top sneakers.
- Let \( r_{l} \) be the number of red low-top sneakers.

We know that 9 pairs are red, so:
\[
r_{h} + r_{l} = 9
\]

For white sneakers:
- Let \( w_{h} \) be the number of white high-top sneakers.
- Let \( w_{l} \) be the number of white low-top sneakers.

We know that 6 pairs are white, so:
\[
w_{h} + w_{l} = 6
\]

High-tops and low-tops are split among red and white sneakers. For high-tops specifically:
- Let \( r_{h} \) be the number of red high-top sneakers.
- Let \( w_{h} \) be the number of white high-top sneakers.

We know that 10 pairs are high-topped, so:
\[
r_{h} + w_{h} = 10
\]

For low-tops specifically:
- Let \( r_{l} \) be the number of red low-top sneakers.
- Let \( w_{l} \) be the number of white low-top sneakers.

We know that 5 pairs are low-topped, so:
\[
r_{l} + w_{l} = 5
\]

To find the least possible value for the fraction representing the number of red high-top sneakers (\( r_h / (10) \)), we minimize \( r_h \).

Given \( r_h + w_h = 10 \), to minimize \( r_h \), maximize \( w_h \):
- Maximum white high-tops: Let's assume all white pairs are low-top, so \( w_h = 6 \). This means \( r_h = 4 \).

We must ensure the numbers fit within the total counts:
- Red sneakers: \( r_l + 4 \) must be at least 9, implying \( r_l \geq 5 \).
- White sneakers: \( 6 - w_l = w_{h} \). If all white high-tops are maximized (6), then \( r_l = 3 \).

Thus, we have:
\[
r_h + w_h = 10
\]
Let's use the minimum possible value for red high-top sneakers:
- Assume there can be 4 red high-top sneakers, leaving at least 5 red low-tops and fitting all criteria.

The fraction of red high-top sneakers in the total collection is then calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{r_h}{10} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Therefore, the least possible value for this fraction is:
$$
\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}
