Q1: ## Step 1: Calculate the difference between 222,222 and 22,222
First, let's calculate the difference between 222,222 and 22,222. This will give us 200,000.

## Step 2: Subtract 2,222 from the result of step 1
Next, we subtract 2,222 from 200,000 to get 197,778.

## Step 3: Subtract 222 from the result of step 2
Then, we subtract 222 from 197,778 to get 197,556.

## Step 4: Subtract 22 from the result of step 3
Next, we subtract 22 from 197,556 to get 197,534.

## Step 5: Subtract 2 from the result of step 4
Finally, we subtract 2 from 197,534 to get 197,532.

## Step 6: Find the ones digit of the final number
The ones digit of a number is the digit in the units place. We need to find this digit for 197,532.

## Step 7: Identify the ones digit
Looking at 197,532, we can see that the ones digit is 2.

Q2: ## Step 1: First, we need to simplify each fraction individually before adding them together.
To do that, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each pair of numbers in the fractions.

## Step 2: For the first fraction 44/11, there is no common factor other than 1, so it can't be simplified further. The second fraction 110/44 has a GCD of 2 since both 110 and 44 are divisible by 2. Simplifying this yields 55/22. The third fraction 44/1100 also has a GCD of 2, simplifying to 22/550.

## Step 3: Now that we have simplified each fraction, let's add them together.
We can now find the sum of these fractions which is (44/11) + (55/22) + (22/550).

## Step 4: To proceed with adding the fractions, we need to find a common denominator for the three fractions. The least common multiple of 11, 22, and 550 is 6050.

## Step 5: We now convert each fraction so that they have a common denominator of 6050.
The first fraction becomes (44 * 550) / (11 * 550), simplifying to 24200/6050. The second fraction becomes (55 * 275) / (22 * 275), simplifying to 15125/6050. The third fraction becomes (22 * 11) / (550 * 11), simplifying to 242/6050.

## Step 6: With all fractions having a common denominator, we can now add them together.
(24200 + 15125 + 242) / 6050 = 38467 / 6050

## Step 7: Simplify the fraction obtained from adding if possible. In this case, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

## Step 8: Since we need to find the decimal value of the expression, we can divide the numerator by the denominator.
38467 divided by 6050 equals approximately 6.3763

## Step 9: However, our answer needs to be in a specific format, which is between dollar signs as a fraction or number.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6.37626315789}$ vs 6.54 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q3: ## Step 1: The sum of the integers from 1 to 9 can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n(n + 1)/2, where n is the last term in the series.
We will use this formula to find the correct sum.

## Step 2: Plugging in the values into the formula, we get: S = 9(9+1)/2
This simplifies to S = 45

## Step 3: We are told that Yunji's incorrect sum is a square number.
To identify which square numbers would result from leaving out one of the integers from 1 to 9, we need to find perfect squares close to our calculated sum.

## Step 4: The perfect square closest and greater than our sum (45) is 49, which is the square of 7.
However, since Yunji's incorrect sum turned out to be a square number after leaving one integer out, we should consider squares less than or equal to 45. These include 1^2 = 1, 4^2 = 16, and 9^2 = 81 but the latter exceeds our range.

## Step 5: Now, let's calculate what numbers Yunji would have left out if her incorrect sum was one of these perfect squares.
If she left out a number to make the sum equal to 1 (which is impossible with positive integers), then that wouldn't tell us anything meaningful in this context. We can ignore 1.

## Step 6: The next perfect square below our target sum is 16, which equals 4^2. If Yunji left out a number such that her sum was 16, then she must have left out the integers that would make up the difference of our calculated sum from this perfect square.
If we subtract 16 from 45, we get 29.

## Step 7: Now let's check which integer from 1 to 9 Yunji could have left out such that her incorrect sum turned out to be a perfect square (in this case, 16). Since the difference between our target sum and the perfect square is 29, it means she must have added all numbers except one.
Since we know the sum of integers from 1 to 9 is 45 and leaving out 7 would make Yunji's incorrect sum a perfect square (49), let's find the number that makes a difference of -4. This suggests there should be an integer missing whose value makes up this difference, which aligns with 4^2 = 16.

## Step 8: Next we'll check if leaving out one more integer results in another perfect square.
When checking the next perfect square below our calculated sum (which is actually above it), let's see how much of a difference is between 45 and any other perfect squares, notably 25 which is 5^2. The numbers to leave out should be those that make up the difference from our target sum.

## Step 9: If Yunji left out an integer such that her incorrect sum turned out to be 25 (the square of 5), we need to find what number would make up this difference.
We calculate the difference between our target sum and the perfect square by subtracting 45 from 25, which gives us a negative value. This suggests we must leave out numbers whose total is greater than 20.

## Step 10: Based on these steps, Yunji left out the number that makes her incorrect sum equal to the perfect square of 16.
This means that the missing integer is the one whose absence results in a difference between our target sum (45) and the next perfect square below it.

## Step 11: Let's determine which specific integer was left out by Yunji.
From the given information, we found the perfect squares closest to or less than our calculated sum of integers from 1 to 9. However, based on the calculation in step 7 that a difference of -4 is required for the incorrect sum to be a square number and aligning with the logic used earlier about checking differences between target sum and other relevant perfect squares, we realize we should identify an integer whose absence makes the sum closer to but not exceeding a perfect square.

## Step 12: Therefore, from these calculations, Yunji left out 7 because leaving it out would bring the incorrect sum closer to being 49 (a perfect square) which was mistakenly considered in an earlier step.
However, we're looking for an answer that fits the context given by considering integers whose absence aligns with differences leading up to perfect squares below our calculated sum.

## Step 13: From this analysis and checking relevant differences, Yunji left out a number that would make her incorrect sum turn into a square, which is indeed less than or equal to our target sum.
Thus we need the correct integer she missed based on the context given.

Q4: ## Step 1
To solve this problem, we need to first determine what combinations of dice rolls will produce a multiple of six.

## Step 2
A standard 6-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6 on its faces. The multiples of 6 that can be formed by rolling two dice are: $6\cdot6=36$, $6\cdot3=18$, and $3\cdot6=18$.

## Step 3
We also need to consider other combinations that produce the same result.

## Step 4
Looking at our list, we see that there are three ways to roll a product of six with two dice: (1, 6), (2, 3), and (3, 2).

## Step 5
Since Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice, the possible sums are integers between $2$ and $12$.

## Step 6
We can analyze each sum from 2 to 12 to see if it's a multiple of six. If we find that none of these values is a multiple of 6, then that number cannot be the sum of the two numbers rolled by Aaliyah.

## Step 7
After examining all the possible sums between $2$ and $12$, we found that only $5$ is not one of them.

Q5: ## Step 1: Determine the possible amounts Taye can have on Tuesday
Taye has $2 initially. He either gains $3 or doubles his money. So, he could have either $2 + $3 = $5 or $2 * 2 = $4.

## Step 2: Calculate the possible amounts for Wednesday based on Tuesday's possibilities
For each of Tuesday's possibilities ($4 and $5), we need to calculate what Taye can have on Wednesday:
- If he had $4, then either he gains $3 (resulting in $7) or doubles his money (resulting in $8).
- If he had $5, then either he gains $3 (resulting in $8) or doubles his money (resulting in $10).

## Step 3: Consider all outcomes for Wednesday to calculate Thursday's possibilities
For each of the Wednesday's possibilities ($7 and $8 from doubling on Tuesday, $7 and $8 from gaining $3 on Tuesday, and $10), we determine what Taye can have on Thursday:
- From $4 -> $7 (gaining) or $8 (doubling),
- From $5 -> $8 (gaining) or $10 (doubling).
Considering all combinations for each day will provide the total amount of possible outcomes.

## Step 4: Enumerate and count distinct possibilities for Thursday
Distinct outcomes on Thursday would be:
- If he doubled on Tuesday and gained on Wednesday ($8),
- If he doubled twice, leading to $16 on Wednesday (but this exceeds the maximum gain from doubling each day after $2),
- If he had $7 or $10 on Wednesday.

## Step 5: Calculate distinct amounts for Thursday based on Wednesday's amounts
For each of these possibilities:
- From $8 (Wednesday), doubling gives $16, and gaining gives $11.
- Since we cannot gain more than a certain amount in one day (3 dollars), the maximum possible outcome is not exceeded with any operation.

## Step 6: Summarize distinct outcomes on Thursday
Thus, we have determined that Taye could end up having either $11 or $16 on Thursday. Other combinations lead to repetitions of these amounts due to previous operations and do not add new possibilities.

Q7: ## Step 1: Calculate the total number of years from 1980 to 2030.
There are $2030 - 1980 = 50$ years.

## Step 2: Determine the increase in CO2 levels over the 50-year period.
The CO2 level increases by about 1.515 ppm each year, so over 50 years it will increase by $1.515 \cdot 50 = 75.75$ ppm.

## Step 3: Calculate the expected CO2 level in January 2030.
In January 1980 the CO2 levels were 338 ppm, and with an increase of 75.75 ppm over the next 50 years, we can calculate the expected CO2 level for January 2030 by adding these two values together.

## Step 4: Perform the calculation to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030.
$\text{Expected CO}_2 \text{ level} = 338 + 75.75$

## Step 5: Round the answer to the nearest integer as required.
$338 + 75.75 = 413.75$, rounded to the nearest integer is 414.

Q10: ## Step 1
We are given an equation where $F L Y F L Y$ represents the greatest number that satisfies $FLYFLY = BUGBUG$. The first step is to rearrange and rewrite the given numbers with letters as digits. We have $FLYFLY=100000+50000+1000+F+L+Y$  which we can then express as $(10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y)$. Next, we must determine the value of $(10^5+10^4)$ using digits. We have $BUGBUG=100000+10000+U+B+G$, so this is also equal to $B(10^3+1)+UG$.

## Step 2
The goal now is to find values for F, L, Y that make $(10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y)$ as large as possible and less than or equal to $BUGBUG$. Since we are trying to maximize the given numbers with letters as digits, we must determine which number has more digits. The two-digit number is $FLYFLY$ while the three-digit number is $BUGBUG$, so it follows that $(10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y) \leq B(10^3+1)+UG$. We have the fact that $B=7$. 

## Step 3
Since we are maximizing the value of both numbers, we need to make sure that F is larger than L and Y. The highest possible values for F, L, and Y can then be determined based on this inequality, which follows from the maximization process.

## Step 4
The next step involves substituting $B=7$ into our equation for $(10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y)$ in order to determine its maximum possible value. This gives us that $(10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y) \leq (1000 + 1)UG = 1001(7 + U)G$. By comparing this to the inequality we derived earlier, it follows that $100000 + 50000 + 1000 + F + L + Y \leq 7000G + G.$

## Step 5
We want to find the maximum possible values for F and G by using the inequality from the previous step. We can do this by determining the minimum value of $(F+L+Y)$, which gives us that $100000+50000+1000+F+L+Y \leq (7001)G$, so then we have that $FLYFLY = 100000+50000+1000+F+L+Y$. By maximizing the value of $F + L + Y$ and using the inequality $(1000+1)UG \geq (10^5+10^4)(F+L+Y)$, we find that it follows that $(F,L,Y)=(9,8,7).$

## Step 6
We have now found the values for F, L, and Y by maximizing their sum using the previous inequality. We can then substitute these values into the original equation in order to determine the value of $BUG$ as well.

## Step 7
By determining that $(F,L,Y)=(9,8,7)$, we can now find the values for U and B by substituting F=9, L=8, Y=7 back into the inequality obtained from the original equation. We have then found all of the possible values for each digit. 

## Step 8
We know that $(F,L,Y)=(9,8,7)$, so we need to use the fact that $B \geq (10^5 + 10^4) - UG$ in order to determine whether B is equal to or greater than $(10^5+10^4)-UG$. We are then able to substitute these values for F=9, L=8, and Y=7 back into the inequality.

## Step 9
We need now to find possible values of U by using our knowledge that $FLYFLY=(9)(18)(15)$, so we can rewrite this as $(10^5+10^4) \cdot (F+L+Y).$ This gives us a new equation where $(100000+50000+1000)+(F+L+Y)= 70000 + F+L+Y$, and then we must find possible values for G. We need to solve this by using the information that $BUG=(10^3+1)UG$.

## Step 10
We have now found all of the necessary values: $(F,L,Y)=(9,8,7)$, so that gives us a value for F, L and Y, we also know that $B=7$ from our previous steps. 

## Step 11
To determine which of U, G or B is largest, we can use our knowledge that the inequality $(1000+1)UG \geq (10^5 + 10^4)(F+L+Y)$ and then solve for each variable to see their values.

## Step 12
Since $B = 7$ from previous steps, we have that the greatest possible value of $(F,L,Y)$ is $(9,8,7).$

Q11: ## Step 1: We need to find out how many multiples of 3 there are from 1 to 81.
The multiples of 3 from 1 to 81 are 3, 6, 9,..., 78. There are a total of 27 multiples of 3 in the given range.

## Step 2: Determine how the product of each row and column is affected by having multiples of 3 in them.
If any number divisible by 3 is included in a row or column, that entire row or column will have a product that is divisible by 3. Therefore, we want to minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3.

## Step 3: Calculate the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.
We must consider the fact that each multiple of 3 can be part of at most one row or column where the product is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we aim to minimize the total count of such rows and columns.

## Step 4: Apply the pigeonhole principle to find a lower bound on the number of rows and columns.
The pigeonhole principle implies that if there are more multiples of 3 than there are rows or columns, then some row or column must contain at least two multiples of 3. This is useful for determining the minimum number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3.

## Step 5: Determine a lower bound on the number of rows and columns based on the pigeonhole principle.
Since we have 27 multiples of 3, there will be a row or column that contains at least two multiples of 3. Furthermore, since each multiple of 3 can be part of at most one row or column where the product is not divisible by 3, this means that we must have at least $\lceil \frac{27}{9} \rceil = 4$ rows and columns with products divisible by 3.

## Step 6: Calculate the final number of rows and columns.
Since it's possible to achieve a configuration where only 4 out of 9 rows and columns are required, we determine that the minimum number is indeed $\boxed{4}.$

Q12: ## Step 1: Calculate the total number of red pairs.
Three fifths of the 15 pairs are red, which means there are $3/5 \times 15 = 9$ red pairs.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of high-top pairs.
Two thirds of the 15 pairs are high-top, so there are $2/3 \times 15 = 10$ high-top pairs.

## Step 3: Determine the minimum overlap between red and high-top pairs to find the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers.
Since we want to minimize the number of red high-top sneakers, we consider that all non-red (white) pairs could be high-tops. Given there are 15 total pairs and 9 are red, this leaves us with $15 - 9 = 6$ white pairs.

## Step 4: If all white pairs were high-top, the number of red high-top pairs would be maximized at a minimum overlap scenario.
With 10 high-tops in total and 6 of them being white (and thus not part of our count for minimizing red high-tops), that leaves us with a maximum $10 - 6 = 4$ red high-top sneakers under the condition that all white pairs are high tops.

## Step 5: Calculate the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers out of the entire collection.
Given there are 15 total pairs and at most 4 could be both red and high-top, the fraction is $4/15$, which is $\frac{4}{15}$.

Q13: ## Step 1: Define the initial ratio and movement of frogs
Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. This means that for every 4 frogs, 3 were green and 1 was yellow. Let's denote the number of green frogs as 3x and the number of yellow frogs as x.

## Step 2: Determine the initial total number of frogs
The total number of frogs is the sum of the green and yellow frogs. Initially, this would be (3x + x) = 4x.

## Step 3: Apply the movement to the numbers of green and yellow frogs
3 green frogs moved to the sunny side, which means the new number of green frogs in the shade is 3x - 3. On the other hand, 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side, so the new number of yellow frogs in the sun is x - 5.

## Step 4: Determine the new total number of frogs
After the movement, we still have (3x - 3) green frogs and (x + 5) yellow frogs because some frogs remain in their original positions. The total number of frogs remains the same as before, so it's also 4x now.

## Step 5: Set up a ratio with the new numbers
We're told that after these movements, the ratio of green to yellow frogs is 4:1. This means (3x - 3)/(x + 5) = 4/1.

## Step 6: Solve for x in the given ratio equation
To solve for x, we cross multiply to get (3x - 3) = 4(x + 5).

## Step 7: Expand and simplify the equation from step 6
Expanding both sides of the equation gives us 3x - 3 = 4x + 20.

## Step 8: Solve for x
Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us -3 = x + 20. Then, subtracting 20 from both sides yields -23 = x.

## Step 9: Find the new number of green and yellow frogs
With x = -23, we can calculate the new numbers. The number of green frogs is (3x - 3) = 3(-23) - 3 = -69 - 3 = -72. However, since you cannot have a negative number of frogs, this calculation was incorrect in assuming x's value directly without considering its implications on ratios and total count correctly. Let's correct the approach focusing on ratio changes instead.

## Step 10: Correctly apply the given movement to set up an equation based on the new ratio
The initial green frogs were 3x, and the yellow ones were x. After moving, the green ones in shade become (3x - 3), and the yellow ones in the shade are (x + 5). The correct approach should consider how these movements affect the total count and the ratio directly.

## Step 11: Formulate an equation based on the movement
The new ratio of green to yellow is given by ((3x - 3) / (x - 5)) = 4/1. However, this equation may lead to complications due to x's value being negative as we previously incorrectly assumed. Let's reassess our approach for solving the initial problem statement directly with correct mathematical operations and ratio application.

## Step 12: Set up an equation based on the new total count of frogs
The initial total number was 4x, but after movement, it remains the same due to frogs being redistributed within the tree. Thus, we should focus on correctly applying the ratios before and after the movement.

## Step 13: Correct approach for ratio changes and solving the equation
Let's consider the green and yellow frogs in their new positions with respect to sun and shade properly, adjusting our calculations accordingly.

## Step 14: Re-evaluate initial conditions
Initially, we had a 3:1 ratio of green to yellow. This means out of every 4 frogs, 3 were green, and 1 was yellow. Let's express the total number of frogs as (3x) + x = 4x.

## Step 15: Apply movement in terms of ratios
After moving, we adjust our ratios based on actual changes - 3 greens moved to sun, 5 yellows moved to shade. This affects our numbers but not the total count directly; rather it's a redistribution within that count.

## Step 16: Formulate the equation correctly with ratio changes due to movement
The new ratio of green to yellow after movement is (4/1), and we need to correct how this reflects on actual frog counts based on initial conditions before adjusting our approach for solving the given problem statement.

## Step 17: Correctly apply ratio to solve for x, using proper initial conditions
Given a 3:1 ratio initially with total frogs being 4x, when considering 3 green and 5 yellow moved as described in the question, it's about how these movements change our view of the original distribution.

## Step 18: Re-evaluate solving for x based on correct formulation of initial conditions
We must reconsider the setup to solve for x properly given initial ratio and movement effects. Given the confusion in prior steps regarding negative values and incorrect applications of ratios, we need a clear step to solve this problem correctly.

## Step 19: Solve for x with accurate application of ratios and movements described
After reassessing the movement's impact on green and yellow frog counts and total count, correct our calculation of what these movements mean in terms of initial conditions provided by ratio before adjustments were made.

## Step 20: Apply corrected solution to find difference between green and yellow frogs after the movement
Now that we understand how many frogs moved from shade to sun and vice versa, let's apply the correct calculations for determining both the current count of green frogs and the count of yellow frogs in the tree post-movement based on established initial conditions before adjustments were applied.

## Step 21: Calculate the new ratio with accurate numbers
Given we understand how many initially green or yellow frogs moved to different areas, now let's apply this correct understanding to calculate what our actual ratios are after these movements for both green and yellow populations.

## Step 22: Apply difference in final counts of green versus yellow frogs based on established calculations
With new, accurate numbers calculated post-movement adjustments according to the provided problem statement initially, we can determine the exact count of how many more green or yellow frogs there are now after redistribution within the given conditions set forth by the question.

## Step 23: Final calculation for difference between the number of green and yellow frogs
Now that we have an accurate understanding of both populations post-movement based on initial conditions, let's directly apply this to find out what the numerical difference is as described in the final query provided at the beginning of our steps for answering.

## Step 24: Apply final numbers from calculations to solve problem correctly
With correct calculations and proper application of ratios before movement adjustments were made, we now solve the question asked about the difference between the green and yellow populations post-redistribution within given conditions set forth by initial scenario provided at start of this reasoning process for answering.

## Step 25: Correctly apply final numbers to find answer as per problem requirements
Given accurate counts based on redistribution after movement within specified conditions, let's use those correct numbers to calculate what the exact difference is between how many green and yellow frogs there are now according to the question asked at beginning of our steps for answering this particular problem.

## Step 26: Calculate final answer with numbers determined correctly in prior steps

Q14: ## Step 1: Determine the total number of ways eight passengers can occupy the 12 seats.
The total number of ways to distribute eight passengers among 12 seats is $12 \choose 8$, since there are 12 possible choices for the first passenger, 11 for the second, and so on until there are 5 choices for the eighth.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.
We need to find the number of ways to seat eight passengers such that any two adjacent seats in a row are not both occupied by a member of the couple. We will count these as the complement of our desired outcome.

## Step 3: Determine the number of rows where no two adjacent seats are occupied by the couple.
In each row, we can select 2 of the passengers to sit next to each other in $8 \choose 2$ ways. However, this overcounts by a factor of 2 since it treats the adjacent pair as one unit. So there are ${8 \choose 2}/2$ possible rows where two adjacent seats are occupied.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability that no row contains an occupied adjacent seat.
To find the number of configurations with no adjacent seats in the same row, we can use complementary counting to determine how many such rows will have exactly one pair of occupied seats. However, our problem is simplified since there are only three other possible combinations.

## Step 5: Calculate the total probability that any given configuration has a couple seated next to each other.
Using this, we calculate the desired probability. vs 20/33 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q16: ## Step 1
First, we need to understand the formula given for calculating wind chill. The formula is (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed). This means that in order to calculate the wind chill, we have to first know the air temperature and the wind speed.

## Step 2
The problem states that the air temperature is 36 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be represented as 36 F.

## Step 3
It also mentions that the wind speed is 18 miles per hour, or mph for short. This means we need to multiply the wind speed by 0.7 in order to get the correct answer.

## Step 4
We must then substitute these values into the formula and perform the arithmetic operations according to the order of operations.

## Step 5
First, we will calculate 0.7 times 18. We have: (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed). Thus, (36) - (0.7)(18)

## Step 6
Multiplying 0.7 and 18 gives us 12.6.

## Step 7
We now substitute this value back into our original equation: (36) - (12.6).

## Step 8
Thus, our final step is to solve for the wind chill by subtracting 12.6 from 36.


The final answer is: $\boxed{23.4}$ vs 23 | Current Accuracy: 6.2%

Q18: ## Step 1: Determine the fraction of the pie that Harold ate.
Harold was able to eat only 1/4 of the pie.

## Step 2: Calculate the remaining portion of the pie after Harold finished eating his share.
The remaining portion is equal to $1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$ of the original pie.

## Step 3: Determine the fraction of the leftover pie that the moose ate.
A moose came by and ate $\frac{1}{3}$ of what Harold left behind, which is equal to $\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$ or $\frac{1}{4}$.

## Step 4: Calculate the remaining portion of the pie after the moose finished eating his share.
The remaining portion is equal to $1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$ of what was left by Harold, which is $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)$ or $\frac{9}{16}$.

## Step 5: Determine the fraction of the leftover pie that the porcupine ate.
A porcupine came by and ate $\frac{1}{3}$ of what the moose left behind, which is equal to $\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{9}{16}\right)$ or $\frac{3}{16}$.

## Step 6: Calculate the remaining portion of the pie after the porcupine finished eating his share.
The remaining portion is equal to $1 - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16}$, which can also be expressed as $\left(1-\frac{3}{16}\right)$ or $\frac{13}{16}$.

## Step 7: Calculate the amount of pie remaining after all three animals had their share.
$\boxed{\frac{13}{16}}$ vs 1/3 | Current Accuracy: 5.6%

Q19: ## Step 1
To determine the rover's average speed, we must first calculate the total distance it traveled and the time it took to travel that distance.

## Step 2
The total distance traveled is given in the prompt as $292,526,838$ miles. This will serve as our numerator for determining speed.

## Step 3
To find the rover's average speed, we must divide this value by the number of hours over which it traveled. We already know that it took $\frac{6.5}{12}$ years to reach Mars, and we can convert this into hours. Therefore, we must multiply $6.5$ by $365 \times 24$, as there are 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day.

## Step 4
The calculation for the time it took to travel is $6.5 \times 365 \times 24$. First, calculate the product of 365 and 24 to get $8,760$ then multiply by 6.5 which gives us $56,290$ hours.

## Step 5
To determine the rover's average speed, we must divide its total distance traveled ($292,526,838$ miles) by the time it took to travel that distance ($56,290$ hours).

## Step 6
Therefore, our final step is calculating $\frac{292,526,838}{56,290}$.

## Step 7
Now calculate $292,526,838 \div 56,290$ which gives us a speed of $5,189.88$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\$5189.88}$ vs 60,000 | Current Accuracy: 5.3%

Q20: ## Step 1: Understand the goal
Nicolas wants to cover the package with a large number of stamps to pay for the postage, which amounts to exactly $7.10.

## Step 2: Convert total cost into cents
To work with the available stamp denominations (5c, 10c, and 25c), convert $7.10 to cents. $7.10 is equal to 710 cents.

## Step 3: Define variables for stamps used
Let's denote x as the number of 5-cent stamps, y as the number of 10-cent stamps, and z as the number of 25-cent stamps that Nicolas will use.

## Step 4: Set up equation based on total value
The total value from all stamps must equal 710 cents. This can be expressed as an equation:
\[5x + 10y + 25z = 710.\]

## Step 5: Account for stamp limits
Since there are exactly 20 of each type, we know that x ≤ 20, y ≤ 20, and z ≤ 20.

## Step 6: Consider objective function to maximize the total number of stamps used
We aim to find the largest possible value of \(x + y + z\) given the constraints.

## Step 7: Find a feasible solution using linear Diophantine equation techniques
Because we have to deal with a multiple-choice question or limited options and a constraint on x, y, and z (since they can't exceed 20), we'll use trial and error with logical reasoning. 

We want the highest total sum without exceeding the available amounts of stamps.

## Step 8: Determine feasible values for each type of stamp
First try to fill the equation with as many high-value stamps as possible (25c) since it will contribute most, then lower denominations. However, we are limited by our goal to use exactly $7.10 and must remember that all types of stamps can only be used up to 20 times.

## Step 9: Calculate using trial and error
Start with z = 20 (25c), calculate how much is left to reach the total value of 710 cents, then see what combinations are possible.

## Step 10: Subtract 25c stamps from the target amount
With z = 20, we subtract 500 c from our goal: 710 - 500 = 210 c. 

## Step 11: Fill in the lower denomination stamps.
Fill in y with as many 10c stamps as possible to minimize x (5c). That means using all 20 of the 25c stamps and trying to use the most 10c stamps first, then the least.

## Step 12: Since we have already removed 500 c from our goal by using 20 * 25 c stamps and are left with a total of 210 cents more to make up, we need to figure out how many 10c stamps will fit into this amount.
We can use y = 13 (130) as we only need to add 80 cents now.

## Step 13: Use remaining value for lowest denomination
For the 5-cent stamps, since our goal is to maximize the total number of stamps used and we've got some remaining value after filling in all other spots with higher-value stamps, we should use the least amount possible as this will give us more overall total.

## Step 14: Solve for x using remaining cents
With 80 c left from step 12, divide by 5 to get the number of additional stamps needed. Since 5 * 16 = 80 and there is no need for a fractional stamp, we use 16 stamps of 5c denomination.

## Step 15: Add up the values of x, y, z
To find our final answer, add all used stamps together.
