Q1: 1. **Identify the Problem:** We need to find the ones digit of the expression \(222,222 - 22,222 - 2,222 - 222 - 22 - 2\).

2. **Calculate Individual Ones Digits:**
   - The ones digit of \(222,222\) is \(2\).
   - The ones digit of \(22,222\) is \(2\).
   - The ones digit of \(2,222\) is \(2\).
   - The ones digit of \(222\) is \(2\).
   - The ones digit of \(22\) is \(2\).
   - The ones digit of \(2\) is \(2\).

3. **Subtract the Ones Digits:** We subtract each of these from \(2\):
   \[
   2 - 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   0 - 2 = -2 \equiv 8 \quad (\text{since } -2 + 10 = 8)
   \]
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   4 - 2 = 2
   \]

4. **Conclusion:** The ones digit of the expression \(222,222 - 22,222 - 2,222 - 222 - 22 - 2\) is \(\boxed{2}\). vs 2 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q3: 1. **Calculate the total sum of integers from 1 to 9:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = \frac{9 \cdot (9+1)}{2} = 45
   \]

2. **Identify the closest square numbers around 45:**
   - \(6^2 = 36\) and \(7^2 = 49\) are the perfect squares closest to 45.

3. **Determine which square number is closer and find the difference:**
   - Since 45 is closer to 36 than to 49, we use 36 as our reference point.
   - The sum without one number should be \(6^2 = 36\).
   - Therefore, the missing number is:
     \[
     45 - 36 = 9
     \]

4. **Verify by checking if 45 minus any other number from 1 to 8 results in a perfect square:**
   - Subtracting 1 through 8 from 45 does not yield a perfect square. For example:
     \[
     45 - 1 = 44, \quad 45 - 2 = 43, \quad 45 - 3 = 42, \quad \text{and so on}
     \]
   - None of these differences are perfect squares except for subtracting 9.

Q6: 1. Let $x$ be the number of green marbles.

2. Then, the number of red marbles is $\frac{x}{2}$ (since Maria has half as many red marbles as green ones).

3. Similarly, the number of blue marbles is $2x$ (as she has twice as many blue marbles as green ones).

4. The total number of marbles is the sum of the red, green, and blue marbles: $\frac{x}{2} + x + 2x = \frac{5x}{2}$.

5. Since the total must be a whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a marble), $x$ needs to be even so that $\frac{5x}{2}$ results in an integer.

6. Let's test some values for $x$. If $x = 4$, then Maria has 4 green marbles, 2 red marbles, and 8 blue marbles, totaling $4 + 2 + 8 = 14$ marbles.

7. Therefore, a possible number of marbles in Maria's collection is $\boxed{14}$. vs 28 | Current Accuracy: 16.7%

Q7: 1. **Determine the number of years from 1980 to 2030:**
   The problem asks for the CO2 level in January 2030, which is 50 years after January 1980.

2. **Calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 50 years:**
   Given that the average annual increase in CO2 levels is 1.515 ppm per year, the total increase over 50 years can be calculated as:
   \[
   1.515 \, \text{ppm/year} \times 50 \, \text{years} = 75.75 \, \text{ppm}
   \]

3. **Add the total increase to the initial CO2 level:**
   The initial CO2 level in January 1980 was 338 ppm. Adding the total increase over 50 years gives:
   \[
   338 \, \text{ppm} + 75.75 \, \text{ppm} = 413.75 \, \text{ppm}
   \]

4. **Round to the nearest integer:**

Q8: 1. First, we need to find the height of the triangle using the coordinates of A and B. Since they share the same y-coordinate, the height is simply the difference in their x-coordinates: $h = |5 - 11| = 6$.

2. Next, let's denote the length of side AB as a. We can calculate this using the distance formula: $a = \sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} = \sqrt{(11-5)^2 + (7-7)^2} = 6$.

3. Now we have enough information to calculate the area of the triangle using the formula $A = \frac{1}{2}ah$. Plugging in our values, we get: $\frac{1}{2}(6)(6) = 18$. However, we were given that the area is 12, so there must be an error in our calculation.

4. The mistake lies in our assumption about the height of the triangle being positive. Since C has a y-coordinate greater than A and B, the actual height should be negative: $h = -6$.

5. Using this corrected value for the height, we can now calculate the area correctly: $\frac{1}{2}(6)(-6) = -18$. But since the area of a triangle cannot be negative, we take its absolute value and set it equal to 12 (the given area): $|\frac{1}{2}(6)h| = 12 \Rightarrow |h| = 4$.

6. Since $h$ is actually negative, we have $h = -4$. Now we can use the distance formula again to find the length of side AC: $|AC| = \sqrt{(x_C - x_A)^2 + (y_C - y_A)^2} = \sqrt{(3-5)^2 + (y-7)^2} = 4$.

7. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $(y-7)^2 = 16 \Rightarrow y-7 = \pm4$. Since $y > 7$, we discard the negative solution and obtain $y = 11$.

Q9: 1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as $x$.
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first tank. So, the number of guppies in the second tank can be represented as $(x + 1)$.
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second tank. So, the number of guppies in the third tank can be represented as $(x + 1) + 2 = (x + 3)$.
4. Lastly, there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third tank. So, the number of guppies in the fourth tank can be represented as $(x + 3) + 3 = (x + 6)$.
5. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given to be 90. So, we can write the equation: $x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90$.
6. Simplifying the left side of the equation gives us $4x + 10 = 90$.
7. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us $4x = 80$.
8. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives us $x = 20$. This is the number of guppies in the first tank.
9. To find the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we substitute $x = 20$ into the expression we found for the number of guppies in the fourth tank, which is $(x + 6)$. So, the number of guppies in the fourth tank is $(20 + 6) = 26$.
10. Therefore, there are $\boxed{26}$ guppies in the fourth tank. vs 26 | Current Accuracy: 11.1%

Q10: 1. **Identify Constraints and Assumptions**:
   Since we are given distinct digits for each letter (F, L, Y, B, U, G), we need to find a combination that maximizes the value of FLY while ensuring FLYFLY equals BUGBUG with unique digits.
   
2. **Maximize FLY**:
   To make FLY as large as possible, we start by assigning the largest available digit to F (since F is repeated twice in FLY). The largest digit we have not used yet is 9, so let's set $F = 9$.
   
3. **Assign Digits to L and Y**:
   Next, we need to maximize L and Y while ensuring they are distinct from each other and from 9. The next largest digits available are 8 and 7. Therefore, let's set $L = 8$ and $Y = 7$. This makes FLY = 987.
   
4. **Form the Equation**:
   We now need to find BUG such that:
   \[
   \text{FLYFLY} = 987987 = \text{BUGBUG}
   \]
   Here, BUG must be a three-digit number where each digit is distinct and not equal to 9, 8, or 7. The largest such number is 654, but we need to check if repeating it (to form six digits) will result in a valid number:
   
   \[
   \text{BUGBUG} = 654654
   \]

5. **Check the Equality**:
   We have:
   \[
   987987 = 654654
   \]
   This does not hold true, so we need to adjust our choices. Let's try the next possible values for BUG that are less than 654 but still form a valid six-digit number when repeated. The next set could be 543:
   
   \[
   \text{BUGBUG} = 543543
   \]

6. **Verify the New Equation**:
   Now we check if:
   \[
   987987 = 543543
   \]
   This also does not hold true. We need to keep adjusting until we find a valid combination. Let's try 432:
   
   \[
   \text{BUGBUG} = 432432
   \]

7. **Final Verification**:
   Now we check if:
   \[
   987987 = 432432
   \]
   This does not hold true either. After further trials, the valid combination is found to be $F = 9$, $L = 6$, $Y = 5$ and $B = 4$, $U = 3$, $G = 2$:
   
   \[
   \text{FLY} = 965, \quad \text{BUG} = 432
   \]

8. **Calculate the Final Answer**:
   We need to find FLY + BUG:
   \[
   \text{FLY} + \text{BUG} = 965 + 432 = 1397
   \]

Thus, the value of FLY + BUG is $\boxed{1397}$. vs 1107 | Current Accuracy: 10.0%

Q11: 1. **Understanding the Problem**: Minh enters numbers from 1 to

81. We need to find the least number of rows and columns where the product is divisible by 3. A product is divisible by 3 if it contains at least one multiple of 3.

2. **Identifying Multiples of 3**: The multiples of 3 between 1 and 81 are: 3, 6, 9, ..., 81. There are $\frac{81}{3} = 27$ multiples of 3 in this range.

3. **Distributing Multiples of 3**: To minimize the number of rows and columns with a product divisible by 3, we should distribute these multiples as evenly as possible across the grid. Since there are 9 rows and 9 columns, we aim to place approximately $\frac{27}{18} = 1.5$ multiples of 3 in each row or column. However, since we cannot have half a multiple, we need to distribute them unevenly.

4. **Optimal Distribution**: Place 2 multiples of 3 in some rows and columns, ensuring that no row or column has more than 2 multiples. This way, the product of any row or column with 2 multiples of 3 will be divisible by 3.

5. **Counting Rows and Columns**: If we place 2 multiples of 3 in each of 9 rows and columns, we ensure that every row and column has at least one multiple of 3. However, this overcounts since each multiple is counted twice (once for the row and once for the column).

6. **Correcting for Overcount**: Since each multiple of 3 is counted in both a row and a column, we should divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Thus, the actual number of rows and columns with a product divisible by 3 is $\frac{18}{2} = 9$.

7. **Conclusion**: The least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is $\boxed{9}$. vs 11 | Current Accuracy: 9.1%

Q12: 1. First, let's find out how many pairs of red sneakers Jordan owns. Three fifths of his total collection is red, so:

Number of red sneakers = Total sneakers * (3/5)
= 15 * (3/5)
= 9 pairs

2. Now, let's find out how many pairs of high-top sneakers Jordan owns. Two thirds of his total collection is high-top, so:

Number of high-top sneakers = Total sneakers * (2/3)
= 15 * (2/3)
= 10 pairs

3. Since we are looking for the fraction of red high-top sneakers, and Jordan has 9 pairs of red sneakers and 10 pairs of high-top sneakers, the least possible value of this fraction is when all red sneakers happen to be high-top:

Fraction of red high-top sneakers = Number of red high-top sneakers / Total number of sneakers
= 9 / 15

   - Let the initial number of green frogs be \(3x\) and the initial number of yellow frogs be \(x\). This sets up our ratio problem with the initial condition being \(\frac{\text{green}}{\text{yellow}} = \frac{3}{1}\).

2. **Movement of Frogs:**
   - 3 green frogs move to the sunny side, so the number of green frogs on the sunny side becomes \(3x + 3\).
   - 5 yellow frogs move to the shady side, so the number of yellow frogs on the shady side becomes \(x + 5\).

3. **New Ratio:**
   - The new ratio of green to yellow frogs is given as \(\frac{4}{1}\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on this ratio:
     \[
     \frac{3x+3}{x} = 4
     \]

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Cross-multiplying to solve for \(x\):

Q14: 1. **Total ways to assign passengers**: There are 12 seats on the plane and we need to find the total number of ways to assign 8 passengers to these seats. This is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $k$ is the number of items to choose. Here, $n=12$ and $k=8$, so we have:
   \[
   \binom{12}{8} = \frac{12!}{8!(12-8)!} = 495
   \]
   This is our denominator.

2. **Ways to assign the married couple**: We need to find the number of ways the married couple can sit together in the same row. There are 4 rows, and in each row, there are $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to choose 2 seats out of 3 for the couple (since they must sit next to each other). So, the total number of ways to place the couple in any row is:
   \[
   4 \times \binom{3}{2} = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

3. **Ways to assign the remaining passengers**: After placing the married couple, we have 6 seats left and 6 remaining passengers. The number of ways to assign these passengers to the remaining seats is:
   \[
   \binom{6}{6} = 1
   \]
   This is because there is only one way to choose all 6 seats for the remaining passengers.

4. **Combining the ways**: The total number of favorable outcomes (where the couple sits together in the same row) is the product of the number of ways to place the couple and the number of ways to assign the remaining passengers:
   \[
   12 \times 1 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculating the probability**: The probability that the married couple will sit together in the same row is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \frac{12}{495}
   \]

6. **Simplifying the fraction**: Simplify the fraction $\frac{12}{495}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{12 \div 3}{495 \div 3} = \frac{4}{165}

2. Plug in the values for air temperature and wind speed: (wind chill) = 36 - 0.7 * 18

3. Calculate the product of 0.7 and 18, which is 12.6: (wind chill) = 36 - 12.6

4. Subtract 12.6 from 36 to get the wind chill: (wind chill) = 23.4

5. Since we want an answer as a number or fraction, and 23.4 is already in decimal form, we can leave it as is. However, if you prefer a fractional answer, we can convert 23.4 to a fraction:
   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of the decimal point: 234/10

   Let \( x \) be the number of 5-cent stamps, \( y \) be the number of 10-cent stamps, and \( z \) be the number of 25-cent stamps used by Nicolas.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   The total value of the stamps must equal $7.10. In cents, this is 710 cents. Therefore:
   \[
   5x + 10y + 25z = 710
   \]
   Additionally, Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp, so:
   \[
   x \leq 20, \quad y \leq 20, \quad z \leq 20
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:
   \[
   x + 2y + 5z = 142
   \]

4. **Maximize \( x \):**
   To maximize the number of stamps, we start by using as many 5-cent stamps as possible. Thus, let's set \( z = 0 \) and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).
   \[
   x + 2y = 142
   \]

5. **Find Integer Solutions:**
   We need to find integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the constraints \( x \leq 20 \) and \( y \leq 20 \).

6. **Test Different Values of \( z \):**
   Since \( z = 0 \) gives us \( x + 2y = 142 \), we try different values of \( z \) to maximize the number of stamps:
   
   - For \( z = 1 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(1) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 137
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (17, 60) \). However, this exceeds the maximum number of 5-cent stamps.
   
   - For \( z = 2 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(2) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 132
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (27, 50.5) \). This is not an integer solution.
   
   - For \( z = 3 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(3) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 127
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (37, 40) \). This exceeds the maximum number of 5-cent stamps.
   
   - For \( z = 4 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(4) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 122
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (47, 27.5) \). This is not an integer solution.
   
   - For \( z = 5 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(5) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 117
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (57, 10.5) \). This is not an integer solution.
   
   - For \( z = 6 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(6) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 112
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (67, 0) \). This exceeds the maximum number of 5-cent stamps.
   
   - For \( z = 7 \):
     \[
     x + 2y + 5(7) = 142 \implies x + 2y = 107
     \]
     Solving for \( x \) and \( y \), we find \( (x, y) = (77, -18.5) \). This is not an integer solution.
   
   The maximum number of stamps that can be used is when \( z = 5 \) with \( x = 20 \), \( y = 34 \), and \( z = 5 \). Thus, the total number of stamps used is:
   \[
   20 + 34 + 5 = 69
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is \(\boxed{69}\). vs 55 | Current Accuracy: 5.0%
