Q3: Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the Sum of the Integers from 1 to 9:**

The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:  n(n + 1)/2

Therefore, the sum of integers from 1 to 9 is (9 * 10) / 2 = 45.

**2. Check for Square Numbers:**

*  When Yunji left out a number, her sum was likely close to a perfect square.
*  Let's check if any numbers are missing that would make the sum a square:

    * The sum of squares from 1 to 9 is (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 9^2) = 81. 


**3. Determine the Missing Number:**

Yunji left out the number **8**. vs 9 | Current Accuracy: 33.3%

Q5: Here's how to figure out the possible amounts:

* **Monday:** $2
* **Tuesday:**  $2 * 2 = $4 (He gains $3)
* **Wednesday:** $4 + $3 = $7 (He gains $3 and doubles his amount)
* **Thursday:** $7 * 2 = $14 (He doubles his amount from Wednesday)

Q9: Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of guppies in the 1st tank.
    * The 2nd tank has 'x + 1' guppies.
    * The 3rd tank has 'x + 2' guppies.
    * The 4th tank has 'x + 2 + 3' guppies (which is equal to 'x + 5').

* **Calculate the total number of guppies:**  
   90 = x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 5) 

* **Combine like terms:**
    90 = 4x + 8

* **Solve for x:**
    82 = 4x
    x = 20.5  (This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem since you can't have fractions of fish)

Q10: Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We need to find values for F, L, Y, B, U, and G that fit specific equations to form numbers.  
* The goal is to determine FLY + BUG when we have restrictions on these digits.

**Strategy:**

1. **Focus on Units Place:** Since F, L, Y, B, U, and G are unique digits, let's start by considering the units place of the resulting number after applying the equation. 
2. **Investigate Possible Unit Values:**  Try to find unit values that would lead to a greater value in the equation based on the other numbers.
3. **Calculate FLY + BUG:** Once we have a suitable arrangement, let's calculate the sum.

Q11: Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding Divisibility Rules:**

* **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  

**Finding the Pattern:**

Let's consider some properties about the numbers from 1 through 81:

1. **Sum of Digits:** To get a product divisible by 3, the sum of the digits within each row/column must be divisible by 3. This is because the product itself will be divisible by 3 if and only if one of the sums involved in the product are.
2. **Multiples of 3:**  The numbers from 1 to 81 have many multiples of 3, but we're looking for a minimum number of rows and columns that can achieve this property.

**Finding the Solution:**

Unfortunately, there's no easy way to deduce the exact number of rows and columns needed just by the given criteria.  

**Explanation:**
To make the product divisible by 3, each row/column has to have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3. We need to find combinations of numbers from 1-81 that can do this.

Q12: Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the number of red sneakers:**

* Three-fifths of Jordan's sneakers are red: (3/5) * 15 = 9 pairs

**2. Calculate the number of white sneakers:**

* The rest of the sneakers are white: 15 - 9 = 6 pairs

**3. Calculate the number of high-top sneakers:**

* Two-thirds of Jordan's sneakers are high-tops: (2/3) * 15 = 10 pairs

**4. Calculate the number of low-top sneakers:**

* The rest are low-tops: 15 - 10 = 5 pairs

**5. Calculate the fraction of red high-top sneakers:**

* We need to find the least possible value for this fraction.  
* Since there's a total of 6 pairs that are not red, we only need to know how many pairs of red high-tops exist.

Q13: Here's how to solve the problem:

**1.  Set up variables:**

* Let  'g' represent the initial number of green frogs.
* Let 'y' represent the initial number of yellow frogs. 

**2.  Create equations based on the given information:**

* We know initially, g/y = 3/1 
* After the movement: (g-3)/(y+5) = 4/1 

**3. Solve for 'g' and 'y':**

* From the first equation, we get g = 3y.
* Substitute this into the second equation:  (3y - 3)/(y + 5) = 4/1 
* Simplify and solve for 'y':
    * 3y - 3 = 4(y + 5)
    * 3y - 3 = 4y + 20
    * -y = 23
    * y = -23  (There's an issue here. A negative number of frogs cannot be realistic)

 **The numbers don't work out, we have to go back and check the problem.**

Q14: Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Total Possible Seat Arrangements:**

* Since there are 4 rows and 3 seats per row, there are  4 * 3 = 12 possible seat arrangements.

**2. Favorable Seat Arrangements:**

* **Consider a row:** Imagine the couple's seat is in the middle of the row.
* **Left & Right Adjacent:** To be adjacent, we need to place them on either the left or right end of the row
* **Number of Rows:** The number of rows is 4.


**3. Calculating the Probability**

The probability of two adjacent seats for a couple is a bit complex to calculate manually.  We will use some logic and math, but it's easier with the help of technology or a table to count possibilities.

Q16: Here's how to calculate the wind chill:

* **Wind Chill = (Air Temperature) - 0.7 * (Wind Speed)**
*  Temperature = 36°F
*  Wind Speed = 18 mph

Plug in the values into the formula:

* Wind Chill = 36°F - 0.7 * 18 mph 
* Wind Chill = 36°F - 12.6 mph

**To find the closest approximation, let's convert the wind speed to degrees Fahrenheit:**

* First, we need to use a conversion formula:  mph to feet per second 
    * Wind Speed in feet/second (ft/s) = 18 mph * 5280 ft/mile / 3600 seconds/hour 
    * Wind Speed in feet/second (ft/s) = 26.4 ft/s
* Now we can convert the wind speed to degrees Fahrenheit:  
   * Convert to degrees Celsius: (Wind Speed * 180°F) / 32°C
   * **Approximate Wind Speed:**  ~25.6°F

**Therefore, the approximate wind chill is $25.6$**.

Q18: Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

* **Harold's leftovers:** Harold ate 1/4 of the pie, leaving 3/4.
* **Moose's portion:** The moose ate 1/3 of Harold's leftover pie, which is (1/3) * (3/4) = 1/4 of the pie.
* **Porcupine's portion:**  The porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind (which was 1/4 of the original pie), so it ate (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12 of the pie.
* **Remaining pie:**  To find out how much is left, subtract the portions eaten by each animal: (3/4) - (1/4) - (1/12) = 7/12

**Therefore, there are 7/12 of the original plum pie still remaining.** vs 1/3 | Current Accuracy: 11.1%

Q20: Here's how to solve the problem:

**1.  Set up the variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of 5-cent stamps.
* Let 'y' represent the number of 10-cent stamps.
* Let 'z' represent the number of 25-cent stamps.

**2. Create an equation to represent the total cost:**

The total value of the stamps must equal $7.10:  
0.05x + 0.10y + 0.25z = 7.10

**3. Use the given number of stamps:** 

We know there are exactly 20 of each type of stamp:
* x = 20
* y = 20
* z = 20

**4. Substitute values into the equation and solve:**

Now we can substitute these values back into the equation to find the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use:
 0.05(20) + 0.10y + 0.25(20) = 7.10
1 + 0.10y + 5 = 7.10
0.10y + 6 = 7.10
0.10y = 1.10
y = 11

**Answer:** Nicolas can use **11** x 10-cent stamps to make exactly $7.10 in postage.
