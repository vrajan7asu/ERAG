Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the ones digit of: 222,222 - 22,222 - 2,222 - 222 - 22 - 2?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by subtracting the largest number from the smallest: $222 - 2 = 220$.
2. Next, subtract $2$ from the result of step 1: $220 - 2 = 218$.
3. Continue this process for each subsequent pair of numbers:
   - Subtract $22$ from the result of step 2: $218 - 22 = 196$.
   - Subtract $222$ from the result of step 3: $196 - 222 = -26$.
   - Subtract $2,222$ from the result of step 4: $-26 - 2,222 = -2,248$.
   - Subtract $22,222$ from the result of step 5: $-2,248 - 22,222 = -24,470$.
4. Finally, subtract $222,222$ from the result of step 6: $-24,470 - 222,222 = -246,692$.
5. The question asks for the ones digit of the final result. To find this, we can simply look at the last digit of $-246,692$, which is $2$.

The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Start by subtracting the smallest number from the largest: 222,222 - 2 = 222,220.
2. Subtract the next smallest number: 222,220 - 222 = 222,008.
3. Continue with the next subtraction: 222,008 - 2,222 = 219,786.
4. Subtract the next number: 219,786 - 22,222 = 197,564.
5. Finally, subtract the last number: 197,564 - 22,222 = 175,342.

The ones digit of the result is $\boxed{2}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's subtract the numbers step by step:
   - $222,222 - 22,222 = 200,000$
   - $200,000 - 2,222 = 197,778$
   - $197,778 - 222 = 197,556$
   - $197,556 - 22 = 197,534$
   - $197,534 - 2 = 197,532$

2. Now, let's find the ones digit of the final result:
   - The ones digit of $197,532$ is $\boxed{2}$.

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: What is the value of this expression in decimal form? 44/11 + 110/44 + 44/1100

Using exemplars:
1. First, we can simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For 44/11, the GCD is 11; for 110/44, the GCD is 22; and for 44/1100, the GCD is

22. Doing this, we get:
   - 44/11 becomes 4/1
   - 110/44 becomes 5/2
   - 44/1100 becomes 1/25

2. Now, we can add these simplified fractions together. Since they all have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before adding them. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50. So, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 50:
   - 4/1 becomes 200/50
   - 5/2 becomes 125/50
   - 1/25 becomes 2/50

3. Now that all the fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together: (200 + 125 + 2) / 50 = 327/50

4. Finally, we convert this fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 327 ÷ 50 = 6.54

\boxed{6.54}
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's simplify the fractions 44/11 and 110/44:
   44/11 = 4 (since 44 divided by 11 equals 4)
   110/44 = 2.5 (since 110 divided by 44 equals 2.5 or 2 and a half)

2. Next, let's simplify the fraction 44/1100:
   Since 44 is not divisible by 1100, we can't simplify this fraction further.

3. Now, let's add these fractions together:
   4 + 2.5 + 44/1100

4. To make the addition easier, let's convert 4 to a decimal by dividing it by 1 (since any number divided by 1 equals itself):
   So, 4 = 4.0

5. Now, let's add these decimals together:
   4.0 + 2.5 + 0.04 (which is the decimal form of 44/1100)

6. Finally, let's add these numbers together to get the total sum:
   4.0 + 2.5 + 0.04 = 6.54

So, the value of the expression in decimal form is $$ \boxed{6.54} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Simplify each term of the expression:
   - The first term is 44/11, which simplifies to 4.
   - The second term is 110/44, which simplifies to 2.5.
   - The third term is 44/1100, which simplifies to 0.04.

2. Add the simplified terms together:
   - 4 + 2.5 + 0.04 = 6.54

3. Express the final answer in the required format:
   - $$ \boxed{6.54} $$

Let's break down the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify Each Fraction

First, we simplify each fraction:

- For \( \frac{44}{11} \):
  - The GCD of 44 and 11 is 11.
  - So, \( \frac{44}{11} = \frac{44 \div 11}{11 \div 11} = 4 \).

- For \( \frac{110}{44} \):
  - The GCD of 110 and 44 is 22.
  - So, \( \frac{110}{44} = \frac{110 \div 22}{44 \div 22} = 5 \).

- For \( \frac{44}{1100} \):
  - The GCD of 44 and 1100 is 4.
  - So, \( \frac{44}{1100} = \frac{44 \div 4}{1100 \div 4} = \frac{11}{275} \).
  - To express this as a decimal:
    - Dividing 11 by 275, we get \( 0.04 \).

### Step 2: Sum the Simplified Terms

Now that we have simplified each fraction to its respective form, we can add them together:

\[
4 + 5 + 0.04
\]

Let's perform this addition step by step:

- First, add \( 4 + 5 = 9 \).
- Then, add the decimal part: \( 9 + 0.04 = 9.04 \).

Thus, the final value of the expression in decimal form is:

\[
\boxed{9.04}
\]
Answer: Let's break down the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify Each Fraction

First, we simplify each fraction:

- For \( \frac{44}{11} \):
  - The GCD of 44 and 11 is 11.
  - So, \( \frac{44}{11} = \frac{44 \div 11}{11 \div 11} = 4 \).

- For \( \frac{110}{44} \):
  - The GCD of 110 and 44 is 22.
  - So, \( \frac{110}{44} = \frac{110 \div 22}{44 \div 22} = 5 \).

- For \( \frac{44}{1100} \):
  - The GCD of 44 and 1100 is 4.
  - So, \( \frac{44}{1100} = \frac{44 \div 4}{1100 \div 4} = \frac{11}{275} \).
  - To express this as a decimal:
    - Dividing 11 by 275, we get \( 0.04 \).

### Step 2: Sum the Simplified Terms

Now that we have simplified each fraction to its respective form, we can add them together:

\[
4 + 5 + 0.04
\]

Let's perform this addition step by step:

- First, add \( 4 + 5 = 9 \).
- Then, add the decimal part: \( 9 + 0.04 = 9.04 \).

Thus, the final value of the expression in decimal form is:

\[
\boxed{9.04}

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: When Yunji added all the integers from 1 to 9, she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9. We know that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, n = 9, a = 1, and l =

9. So, the total sum is 9/2 * (1 + 9) = 45.

2. Next, we need to find a square number that is less than or equal to 45, since Yunji's incorrect sum must be a square number and she left out a number. The possible square numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. However, 49 is not less than or equal to 45, so we can eliminate it.

3. Now, let's find the number that Yunji left out by subtracting each possible square number from the total sum of 45 and checking if the result is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If such a number exists, then it must be the number Yunji left out.

- Subtracting 1 from 45 gives 44, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 4 from 45 gives 41, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 9 from 45 gives 36, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 16 from 45 gives 29, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 25 from 45 gives 20, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- However, subtracting 36 from 45 gives 9, which is an integer between 1 and 9.

Therefore, the number that Yunji left out must be 36, because her incorrect sum was a square number (36), and when we add this number back to the sum, we get the correct total sum of all integers from 1 to 9.

$$ \boxed{36} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the sum of all integers from 1 to 9 without leaving any number out. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (n/2) * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
   Sum = (9/2) * (1 + 9) = 45

2. Next, we need to find a square number that is less than 45. The largest perfect square less than 45 is 36 (which is 6^2).

3. If Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then the number she left out would be the difference between the correct sum and her incorrect sum: 45 - 36 = 9.

So, $$ \boxed{9} $$ is the answer. Yunji must have left out the number 9.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 9. This is an arithmetic series with n=9, a_1=1, and a_n=

9. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S_n = n*(a_1+a_n)/2. Plugging in our values, we get:
   S_9 = 9 * (1 + 9) / 2 = 45

2. Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number. The closest square numbers to 45 are 36 and 49. Since 45 is between these two squares, the missing number must be one of them.

3. If the missing number was 36, then the sum of the integers from 1 to 8 would be:
   S_8 = 8 * (1 + 8) / 2 = 36
   Adding back the missing number gives us a total of 72, which is not equal to 45.

4. If the missing number was 49, then the sum of the integers from 1 to 10 would be:
   S_10 = 10 * (1 + 10) / 2 = 55
   Subtracting back the missing number gives us a total of 55 - 49 = 6, which is equal to 45.

5. Therefore, Yunji left out the number 49.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{49} $$

To solve this problem, we will follow a similar approach to the provided examples.

1. **Calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9:**

   Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}
   \]
   
   Here, \( n = 9 \), \( a_1 = 1 \), and \( a_n = 9 \).
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   S_9 = \frac{9(1 + 9)}{2} = \frac{9 \times 10}{2} = 45
   \]

2. **Identify the possible square numbers less than or equal to 45:**
   
   The perfect squares within this range are:
   \( 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16, 5^2 = 25, \) and \( 6^2 = 36. \)

3. **Determine the missing number by checking each square number:**

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 1:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 1 = 44 \quad (\text{not a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 4:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 4 = 41 \quad (\text{not a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 9:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 9 = 36 \quad (\text{not a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 16:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 16 = 29 \quad (\text{not a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 25:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 25 = 20 \quad (\text{not a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

   - If Yunji's incorrect sum was 36:
     \[
     S_{\text{correct}} = 45
     \]
     The difference is:
     \[
     45 - 36 = 9 \quad (\text{a valid number between 1 and 9})
     \]

Since the only possible square number that results in a valid number when subtracted from 45 (which is within the range of numbers Yunji could have left out, i.e., 1 to 9) is 36, we conclude:

\[
Yunji's \text{ correct sum} = 45 - 36 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number Yunji left out is:

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice. She notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. Which of the following integers cannot be the sum of the two numbers?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the problem**: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice, and she notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. We need to find which integer cannot be the sum of the two numbers.

2. **Analyzing the condition**: For the product of the two numbers to be a multiple of 6, at least one of the dice must show a number that is a factor of 6 (i.e., 2, 3, or 6).

3. **Case 1 - One die shows a 6**: If one die shows a 6, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6. The possible sums in this case are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$.

4. **Case 2 - One die shows a 3**: If one die shows a 3, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 3 (since $3 \times 3$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

5. **Case 3 - One die shows a 2**: If one die shows a 2, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 2 (since $2 \times 2$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.

6. **Combining all cases**: From the three cases above, we see that the only sum that does not appear is $10$.

Therefore, the integer that cannot be the sum of the two numbers is $\boxed{10}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. For the product of two numbers to be a multiple of 6, at least one of them must be a multiple of 2 (even) and at least one must be a multiple of 3 (odd).
2. So, we have pairs where one die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6) and the other shows a multiple of 3 (3 or 6). The possible sums are:
   - 2 + 3 = 5
   - 2 + 6 = 8
   - 4 + 3 = 7
   - 4 + 6 = 10
   - 6 + 3 = 9
   - 6 + 6 = 12
3. The sums that are not possible from these pairs are numbers less than 5 or greater than 12, but also those not listed above like 11 and 13.
4. Therefore, the integer that cannot be the sum of the two numbers is $$ \boxed{11} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's list all possible products of two dice rolls that are multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and

54.

2. Now, let's find the sums of each pair of numbers that result in these products. The pairs are:

To solve this problem, we need to analyze which sums are not possible when the product of the numbers on the two dice is a multiple of 6. We'll break down the conditions for the product being a multiple of 6 and then determine the corresponding sums.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the condition**:
   - The product of two numbers rolled on a standard die (which can be any integer from 1 to 6) is a multiple of 6 if at least one of them is a multiple of 2 and at least one is a multiple of 3.

2. **Possible cases**:
   - One die shows a number that is a multiple of 2: {2, 4, 6}
   - The other die shows a number that is a multiple of 3: {3, 6}

### Case Analysis

#### Case 1: One die shows a multiple of 2 (even) and the other shows a multiple of 3:
- If one die shows a 2, then the other can show 3 or 6. Possible sums are \(2 + 3 = 5\), \(2 + 6 = 8\).
- If one die shows a 4, then the other can show 3 or 6. Possible sums are \(4 + 3 = 7\), \(4 + 6 = 10\).
- If one die shows a 6, then the other can show 3 or 6. Possible sums are \(6 + 3 = 9\), \(6 + 6 = 12\).

### Combining all cases:
The possible sums from these scenarios are: \(5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 12\).

#### Case 2: One die shows a multiple of 3 and the other shows a multiple of 2 (even):
- If one die shows a 3, then the other can show 2 or 6. Possible sums are \(3 + 2 = 5\), \(3 + 6 = 9\).
- If one die shows an 8 (which is not possible since we are using standard dice, which only have numbers from 1 to 6) then the scenario doesn't apply here.
- No valid scenarios exist with a number on one die being 4 because no other numbers can make the product a multiple of 6 in this context.

### Summarizing:
The possible sums are: \(5, 8, 7, 9, 10, 12\).

### Identifying the integer that cannot be the sum:

Looking at all combinations and sums provided:
- The only sums that do not appear in our list of possible sums are those outside of the set \(\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12\}\).

Thus, the integer that cannot be the sum is \(13\).

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: On Monday, Taye has $2. Every day, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. How many different dollar amounts could Taye have on Thursday, 3 days later?

Using exemplars:
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. The next day, Tuesday, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount from Monday. So, on Tuesday, he could have either $5 (if he gained $3) or $4 (if he doubled his money).
3. Now, let's consider each case for Wednesday:
   - If Taye had $5 on Tuesday and gained $3, then he would have $8 on Wednesday. But, if he doubled the amount from Tuesday, he would have $10. So, there are two possibilities for Wednesday.
   - If Taye had $4 on Tuesday and gained $3, he would have $7 on Wednesday. And if he doubled his money, he would still have $8. So again, there are two possibilities for Wednesday.
4. For Thursday:
   - Starting with $8: This amount can be reached in two ways - by gaining $3 from $5 or by doubling the money from $4 on Tuesday. After doubling $8, Taye would have $16.
   - Starting with $7: This can only be achieved by gaining $3 from $4 (since doubling $3.5 is not possible). Doubling $7 gives us $14.
   - Starting with $10: The only way to reach this is by doubling the money from $5 on Tuesday. Doubling $10 leads to $20.
5. So, Taye could have 3 different amounts of money on Thursday: $$ \boxed{14, 16, 20} $.
--------------------------------------------------
1. On Monday, Taye has $2. This is the starting point.
2. The problem states that every day, Taye either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. This means that the amount of money Taye has can change in two ways each day: it can increase by $3, or it can be multiplied by 2 (doubled).
3. Let's consider all the possible ways Taye could have money on Thursday. Since there are two choices for each of the three days after Monday, there are a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes for the amount of money Taye has on Thursday.
4. Now let's list out all these possibilities:
   - If he gains $3 each day, then he will have 2 + 3*3 = $11 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money each day, then he will have 2 * 2 * 2 = $8 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 for two days and then doubles his money once, then he will have (2 + 3) * 2 = $10 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 one day and doubles his money the next day, then he will have 2 * (2 + 3) = $10 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money for two days and then gains $3, then he will have 2 * 2 * (2 + 3) = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money once and then gains $3 for two days, then he will have (2 + 3) * 2 * 2 = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money the first day, gains $3 the second day, and then doubles his money again, then he will have 2 * (2 + 3) * 2 = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 for two days and then doubles his money, then he will have (2 + 3) * (2 + 3) = $25 on Thursday.
5. Therefore, the different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday are: $11, $8, $10, $10, $20, $20, $20, and $25.
--------------------------------------------------
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. On Tuesday, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Monday. So, there are two possibilities for his money on Tuesday:
   - If he gains $3, then he has $2 + $3 = $5.
   - If he doubles his money, then he has $2 * 2 = $4.
3. On Wednesday, he again either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Tuesday. So, there are two possibilities for each scenario:
   - If he gained $3 on Tuesday, then he has $5 + $3 = $8 or $5 * 2 = $10.
   - If he doubled his money on Tuesday, then he has $4 + $3 = $7 or $4 * 2 = $8.
4. On Thursday, he again either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Wednesday. So, there are two possibilities for each scenario:
   - If he gained $3 on Wednesday, then he has $8 + $3 = $11 or $8 * 2 = $16 or $10 + $3 = $13 or $10 * 2 = $20.
   - If he doubled his money on Wednesday, then he has $7 + $3 = $10 or $7 * 2 = $14 or $8 + $3 = $11 or $8 * 2 = $16.
5. Therefore, the different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday are $10, $11, $13, $14, $16, and $20.

Let's break down each possible scenario for Monday to Thursday step by step.

1. **Monday**: Taye has $2.
   
2. **Tuesday**:
   - If he gains $3, then he will have $2 + 3 = $5.
   - If he doubles his money, then he will have $2 * 2 = $4.

3. **Wednesday**:
   - Starting with $5 on Tuesday, let's consider both possibilities for Wednesday given each scenario from Tuesday:

     a) If he gained $3 on Tuesday, then:
        - He has $5 + 3 = $8.
        - He doubles his money: $8 * 2 = $16.

     b) If he doubled his money on Tuesday, then:
        - He has $4 * 2 = $8.
        - He gains $3: $8 + 3 = $11.

   Therefore, for Wednesday, the possible amounts are:
   - $8 (from doubling $5 or gaining $3 from $4)
   - $16 (from doubling $8)
   - $11 (from gaining $3 on $8)

4. **Thursday**:
   - Starting with $8 and considering both scenarios from Wednesday:
     a) If he gained $3 on Tuesday, then:
        - He has $5 + 3 = $8.
        - From there, he doubles: $8 * 2 = $16.

     b) If he doubled his money on Tuesday, then:
        - He has $4 * 2 = $8.
        - From there, he gains $3: $8 + 3 = $11.

   Therefore, for Thursday, the possible amounts are:
   - $16 (from doubling $8 or gaining $3 from $5)
   - $11 (from doubling $4)

Combining all these scenarios from Tuesday and Wednesday to Thursday, we get the following unique dollar amounts:
- Starting with $2 on Monday, he could end up with:
  - $8 (doubling first then doubling again) or
  - $16 (gaining first then doubling again).

Summarizing, there are **3 different** possible amounts of money that Taye could have on Thursday.

The final answer is: $$ 3 $$

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: All the marbles in Maria's collection are red, green, or blue. Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Which of the following could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G.
2. According to the problem, there are half as many red marbles as green marbles, so we can represent the number of red marbles as R = 0.5G.
3. Similarly, there are twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so we can represent the number of blue marbles as B = 2G.
4. The total number of marbles in Maria's collection is the sum of the red, green, and blue marbles, which can be represented as T = R + G + B.
5. Substituting the expressions for R and B from steps 2 and 3 into the equation for T from step 4, we get T = 0.5G + G + 2G = 3.5G.
6. Therefore, the total number of marbles in Maria's collection is a multiple of 3.5 times the number of green marbles.
7. The only answer choice that is a multiple of 3.5 is 140 (i.e., 140 = 3.5 * 40).

Hence, the total number of marbles in Maria's collection could be $ \boxed{140} $.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let R represent the number of red marbles, G for green marbles, and B for blue marbles.
2. We know that Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, so R = G/2.
3. Similarly, she has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so B = 2G.
4. The total number of marbles is given by the equation T = R + G + B.
5. Substituting our expressions for R and B in terms of G, we get: T = (G/2) + G + (2G).
6. Simplifying this expression, we have: T = 3.5G.
7. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be an even multiple of 10 for T to be an integer (because 3.5 times an even multiple of 10 will result in a whole number).
8. Therefore, possible values for G are 20, 40, 60, etc., and correspondingly, the total number of marbles T can be 70, 140, 210, etc.

Final answer: The total number of marbles could be any multiple of 70, such as $$ \boxed{70} $$, $$ \boxed{140} $$, $$ \boxed{210} $$, etc.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G. According to the problem, Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, so she has G/2 red marbles. She also has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so she has 2G blue marbles.

2. The total number of marbles in Maria's collection is the sum of the red, green, and blue marbles. So, the total number of marbles is G/2 + G + 2G = (7/2)G.

3. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be an even number so that (7/2)G is also a whole number.

4. The problem asks which of the given options could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection. To find this out, we need to check if any of the options can be expressed as (7/2)G for some even G.

5. Let's check each option:
   - 10 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 14 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 28 = 7 * 4, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 8. So, the total number of marbles could be 28.
   - 35 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 42 = 7 * 6, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 12. But since the problem states that Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, G can't be more than 8 (otherwise, there would be more blue marbles than all the other marbles combined). So, 42 is not a possible total number of marbles.
   - 56 = 7 * 8, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 16. But again, since G can't be more than 8, 56 is not a possible total number of marbles.

So, the final answer is \boxed{28}.

To solve this problem, we will denote the number of green marbles as \( G \).

1. According to the problem:
   - The number of red marbles is half the number of green marbles, so \( R = \frac{G}{2} \).
   - The number of blue marbles is twice the number of green marbles, so \( B = 2G \).

2. The total number of marbles in Maria's collection can be represented as:
   \[
   T = R + G + B
   \]

3. Substituting \( R \) and \( B \) with their expressions in terms of \( G \):
   \[
   T = \frac{G}{2} + G + 2G
   \]

4. Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   T = \frac{G}{2} + G + 2G = \frac{G}{2} + \frac{2G}{2} + \frac{4G}{2} = \frac{G + 2G + 4G}{2} = \frac{7G}{2}
   \]

5. For \( T \) to be a whole number, \( \frac{7G}{2} \) must result in an integer. This implies that \( G \) must be an even number since \( \frac{7}{2} \times 14 = 49 \).

6. Let’s denote the total number of marbles as \( T = \frac{7G}{2} \). Since \( G \) is even, we can write \( G = 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer.

   Therefore,
   \[
   T = \frac{7(2k)}{2} = 7k
   \]

Now let's check the given options to see which one could be expressed as \( 7k \):

- **10**: Not a multiple of 7.
- **14**: Not a multiple of 7.
- **28**: Multiple of 7 (\( 7 \times 4 = 28 \)).
- **35**: Not a multiple of 7.
- **42**: Not a multiple of 7.
- **56**: Not a multiple of 7.

Therefore, the only option that is \( 7k \) where \( k \) is an integer is \( 28 \).

So, the total number of marbles in Maria's collection could be:

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: In January 1980 the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of 338 ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average (CO2) reading has increased by about 1.515 ppm each year. What is the expected CO2 level in ppm in January 2030? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed from January 1980 to January 2030.
   Years passed = (Year - Initial year) + 1
               = (2030 - 1980) + 1
               = 50 + 1
               = 51 years

2. Next, we need to calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 51 years.
   Total increase = Increase per year * Years passed
                  = 1.515 ppm/year * 51 years
                  = 77.0835 ppm

3. Finally, we add the total increase to the initial CO2 level to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030.
   Expected CO2 level = Initial CO2 level + Total increase
                      = 338 ppm + 77.0835 ppm
                      = 415.0835 ppm

4. Since we need to round the answer to the nearest integer, the expected CO2 level in January 2030 is \boxed{415}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's determine how many years have passed from 1980 to 2030. The difference in years is $2030 - 1980 = 50$ years.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 50 years. Since the average increase is about 1.515 ppm per year, we multiply this rate by the number of years: $50 \times 1.515 = 75.75$ ppm.

3. Finally, to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030, we add the initial CO2 level from 1980 (338 ppm) to the total increase over the years: $338 + 75.75 = 413.75$ ppm.

4. Rounding this result to the nearest integer gives us a final answer of $\boxed{414}$ ppm.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed from January 1980 to January 2030. That would be 50 years (2030 - 1980).

2. Next, we multiply the number of years by the annual increase in CO2 levels: 50 * 1.515 = 75.75 ppm

3. Then, add this increase to the initial CO2 level: 338 + 75.75 = 413.75 ppm

4. Finally, round the answer to the nearest integer: 414 ppm

So, the expected CO2 level in January 2030 would be \boxed{414} ppm.

Q: The coordinates of triangle ABC are A(5,7), B(11,7), and C(3,y), with y > 7. The area of triangle ABC is 12. What is the value of y?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find the length of side AB. Since both points A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is parallel to the x-axis and its length can be found by subtracting their x-coordinates: |5 - 11| = 6 units.
2. Next, let's find the height of triangle ABC from point C to side AB. Since AC and BC are not parallel to the x-axis (as y > 7), we can use their slopes to find the height. The slope of line AC is (y - 7) / (3 - 5) = -(y - 7)/2, while the slope of line BC is 0 because it's parallel to the x-axis.
3. Now let's denote the point D as the intersection of the height from C with side AB. Since the slopes of lines AD and CD are negative reciprocals of each other (because they are perpendicular), we can write the equation for line AD as y = -2(x - 5) + 7.
4. To find the x-coordinate of point D, we need to set the equations for lines AD and AB equal to each other and solve for x: -2(x - 5) + 7 = 7 => x = 5.
5. Since we know that y > 7, let's assume a value for y, say y = 8, and check if the area of triangle ABC is equal to 12 units squared: Area = (base * height) / 2 = (6 * |8 - 7|) / 2 = 6.
6. To get an area of 12 units squared, we need to increase the height by a factor of 2: Height = 2 * 6 = 12 units.
7. Now we can find the value of y using the equation for line AD and the x-coordinate of point D (which is 5): y = -2(5 - 5) + 7 + Height = 7 + 12 = 19.
8. Therefore, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{19} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the distance between points A and B (which are on the same horizontal line). Since they have the same y-coordinate, we can use the formula for distance:
   Distance = |x2 - x1|
   So, AB = |5 - 11| = 6 units

2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
   We know that the base (AB) is 6 units and the area is 12 square units. Therefore, we can find the height:
   12 = (1/2) * 6 * height
   Solving for height gives us: height = 4 units

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the y-coordinates of points A and B plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + 7 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the value of y is \boxed{18}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the length of AB. Since both A and B have the same y-coordinate, the length of AB is just the difference in their x-coordinates, which is |11 - 5| = 6.
2. Next, we need to find the height of the triangle, which will be the distance from point C to the line AB. Since A and B are on the same horizontal line (y=7), the height h of the triangle can be found by subtracting the y-coordinate of point A from y: h = y - 7.
3. The area of a triangle is given by the formula Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the area is 12 and the base is AB = 6. So we can set up the equation: 12 = (1/2) * 6 * h.
4. Solving for h gives us h = 12 / (1/2) * 6 = 4.
5. Now we know that the height of the triangle is 4, so y - 7 = 4.
6. Solving for y gives us y = 4 + 7 = 11.

So the value of y is $$ \boxed{11} $$.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Find the length of side AB**:
   - Both points A and B have the same \(y\)-coordinate (7), which means line segment AB is parallel to the x-axis.
   - The distance between points A(5, 7) and B(11, 7) is given by the formula for the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
     \[
     AB = |x_2 - x_1| = |11 - 5| = 6
     \]
   So, \(AB = 6\) units.

2. **Find the height of triangle ABC**:
   - The base of the triangle is \(AB\), which has a length of 6 units.
   - We need to find the height from point C(3, y) perpendicular to line AB. Since AB is parallel to the x-axis and passes through points A(5, 7) and B(11, 7):
     \[
     \text{Height} = |y - 7|
     \]
   The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Given that the area is 12 units², and substituting \(AB\) as the base and height we found:
   \[
   12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times |y - 7|
   \]

3. **Solve for the height**:
   - Simplify the equation to solve for \(|y - 7|\):
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times |y - 7| \\
     12 = 3 \times |y - 7|
     \]
     \[
     |y - 7| = \frac{12}{3} \\
     |y - 7| = 4
     \]

   This gives us two possible values for \(y - 7\):
   - \(y - 7 = 4\) or \(y - 7 = -4\)

4. **Solve for y**:
   - For \(y - 7 = 4\):
     \[
     y = 11
     \]
   - For \(y - 7 = -4\):
     \[
     y = 3
     \]

Given that we are told \(y > 7\), the value of \(y\) that satisfies this condition is:
\[
y = 11
\]

Thus, the value of \(y\) is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
Answer: Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Find the length of side AB**:
   - Both points A and B have the same \(y\)-coordinate (7), which means line segment AB is parallel to the x-axis.
   - The distance between points A(5, 7) and B(11, 7) is given by the formula for the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
     \[
     AB = |x_2 - x_1| = |11 - 5| = 6
     \]
   So, \(AB = 6\) units.

2. **Find the height of triangle ABC**:
   - The base of the triangle is \(AB\), which has a length of 6 units.
   - We need to find the height from point C(3, y) perpendicular to line AB. Since AB is parallel to the x-axis and passes through points A(5, 7) and B(11, 7):
     \[
     \text{Height} = |y - 7|
     \]
   The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Given that the area is 12 units², and substituting \(AB\) as the base and height we found:
   \[
   12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times |y - 7|
   \]

3. **Solve for the height**:
   - Simplify the equation to solve for \(|y - 7|\):
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times |y - 7| \\
     12 = 3 \times |y - 7|
     \]
     \[
     |y - 7| = \frac{12}{3} \\
     |y - 7| = 4
     \]

   This gives us two possible values for \(y - 7\):
   - \(y - 7 = 4\) or \(y - 7 = -4\)

4. **Solve for y**:
   - For \(y - 7 = 4\):
     \[
     y = 11
     \]
   - For \(y - 7 = -4\):
     \[
     y = 3
     \]

Given that we are told \(y > 7\), the value of \(y\) that satisfies this condition is:
\[
y = 11

Thus, the value of \(y\) is:

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: Rohan keeps a total of 90 guppies in 4 fish tanks. There is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank. There are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank. How many guppies are in the 4th tank?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as x.
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first tank. So, the number of guppies in the second tank can be represented as (x + 1).
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second tank. Therefore, the number of guppies in the third tank is (x + 3).
4. And there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third tank. Hence, the number of guppies in the fourth tank can be represented as (x + 6).
5. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given as 90. So, we can set up an equation to represent this: x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90
6. Simplifying the equation gives us: 4x + 10 = 90
7. Solving for x, we find that x = 20. This means there are 20 guppies in the first tank.
8. To find the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we substitute x = 20 into the expression (x + 6). So, the number of guppies in the fourth tank is: (20 + 6) = $$46$$
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the 1st tank as G1.
2. Since there is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st, we can denote the number of guppies in the 2nd tank as G1 + 1.
3. Similarly, since there are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd, we can denote the number of guppies in the 3rd tank as (G1 + 1) + 2 = G1 + 3.
4. And since there are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd, we can denote the number of guppies in the 4th tank as (G1 + 3) + 3 = G1 + 6.
5. We know that the total number of guppies in all tanks is 90, so we can set up an equation: G1 + (G1 + 1) + (G1 + 3) + (G1 + 6) = 90.
6. Solving this equation gives us: 4G1 + 10 = 90 => 4G1 = 80 => G1 = 20.
7. Substituting G1 into our expression for the number of guppies in the 4th tank, we get: G1 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26.

Final answer: There are $\boxed{26}$ guppies in the 4th tank.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as G1.
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank, so the number of guppies in the second tank is G1 + 1.
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank, so the number of guppies in the third tank is (G1 + 1) + 2 = G1 + 3.
4. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank, so the number of guppies in the fourth tank is (G1 + 3) + 3 = G1 + 6.
5. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is 90, so we have the equation: G1 + (G1 + 1) + (G1 + 3) + (G1 + 6) = 90.
6. Simplifying this equation gives us 4G1 + 10 = 90.
7. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us 4G1 = 80.
8. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us G1 = 20.
9. So, there are 20 guppies in the first tank, 21 in the second tank (G1 + 1), 23 in the third tank (G1 + 3), and 26 in the fourth tank (G1 + 6).

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{26} $$

Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

1. Denote the number of guppies in the first tank as \( G_1 \).
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first tank, so the number of guppies in the second tank can be represented as \( G_1 + 1 \).
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second tank, thus the number of guppies in the third tank is \( (G_1 + 1) + 2 = G_1 + 3 \).
4. And there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third tank, hence the number of guppies in the fourth tank can be represented as \( (G_1 + 3) + 3 = G_1 + 6 \).

Given that the total number of guppies in all four tanks is 90, we set up the equation:
\[ G_1 + (G_1 + 1) + (G_1 + 3) + (G_1 + 6) = 90. \]

5. Simplifying this equation:
\[
G_1 + G_1 + 1 + G_1 + 3 + G_1 + 6 = 90,
\]
\[
4G_1 + 10 = 90.
\]

6. Solving for \( G_1 \):
\[
4G_1 = 80,
\]
\[
G_1 = 20.
\]

7. Knowing that:
- The first tank has \( G_1 = 20 \) guppies, 
- The second tank has \( G_1 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21 \) guppies,
- The third tank has \( G_1 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \) guppies,
- The fourth tank has \( G_1 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 \) guppies.

Therefore, the number of guppies in the fourth tank is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]

1. Denote the number of guppies in the first tank as \( G_1 \).
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first tank, so the number of guppies in the second tank can be represented as \( G_1 + 1 \).

4. And there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third tank, hence the number of guppies in the fourth tank can be represented as \( (G_1 + 3) + 3 = G_1 + 6 \).

Given that the total number of guppies in all four tanks is 90, we set up the equation:
\[ G_1 + (G_1 + 1) + (G_1 + 3) + (G_1 + 6) = 90. \]

5. Simplifying this equation:
\[
G_1 + G_1 + 1 + G_1 + 3 + G_1 + 6 = 90,
\]
\[
4G_1 + 10 = 90.
\]

6. Solving for \( G_1 \):
\[
4G_1 = 80,
\]
\[
G_1 = 20.

- The third tank has \( G_1 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \) guppies,
- The fourth tank has \( G_1 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 \) guppies.

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Let the letters F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits. Suppose F L Y F L Y is the greatest number that satisfies the equation FLYFLY = BUGBUG. What is the value of FLY + BUG?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand that FLYFLY and BUGBUG are six-digit numbers where the first three digits are the same as the last three digits.
2. Since FLYFLY is greater than BUGBUG, we can infer that F > U and Y > G. This is because a larger digit in the ten thousands place will result in a larger number.
3. Now, let's consider the smallest possible values for G and Y. The smallest digit that G can be is 0 (since it's distinct from all other digits and Y > G), which makes Y at least 1.
4. If Y were 1, then F would have to be less than 2 to satisfy F > U. But there's no digit U that's smaller than 2. So, Y must be at least 2.
5. With Y being at least 2, G can only be 0 or 1. If G were 1, then F would have to be less than 3. Again, there's no digit U that's smaller than 3. So, G must be 0.
6. Now, we know that Y is at least 2 and G is 0. This means that F must be greater than 1 (since F > U and the smallest possible value for U is 0) and less than or equal to 9 (since it's a digit). The only digit that fits this description is 3.
7. So, we have F = 3 and Y = 2. This means that G = 0 and U can be any digit from 1 to 8.
8. To find the largest possible value for BUGBUG, we should choose the largest possible value for U, which is 8.
9. Therefore, FLYFLY = 323323 and BUGBUG = 808808.
10. Finally, to find the value of FLY + BUG, we add these two numbers together: (3 * 10^5) + (2 * 10^4) + (3 * 10^3) + (3 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (3 * 10^0) + (8 * 10^5) + (0 * 10^4) + (8 * 10^3) + (8 * 10^2) + (0 * 10^1) + (8 * 10^0) = 119,311.

So, the final answer is $$ \boxed{119311} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We know that FLYFLY is the greatest number that can be represented as a product of two distinct digits (BUGBUG).
2. Since FLYFLY is a multiple of BUG, it must also be a multiple of 3 (as the sum of its digits is 6 * F + L + Y).
3. The only way for FLYFLY to be a multiple of 3 and have distinct digits is if F = 1 and L + Y = 5 (since 1 + L + Y must be divisible by 3, but not equal to 9 or 12, as those would result in repeating digits).
4. The possible values for L and Y are 2 and 3, respectively (as they are distinct digits and their sum is 5).
5. So, FLYFLY = 123123.
6. Since BUG is a factor of 123123, it must also be divisible by 3. The only possible value for B is 3 (since it's the smallest digit that satisfies this condition).
7. Therefore, BUG = 303 and FLY + BUG = 123 + 303 = $426$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits and F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G. This means that the number on the left side of the equation (FLYFLY) is equal to the number on the right side (BUGBUG).
2. Since both sides of the equation are 6-digit numbers, we can infer that each letter represents a unique digit from 0-9. However, no digit can be zero because division by zero would not result in an integer solution. Therefore, digits F and B cannot be zero.
3. To find the value of F, let's assume F = 1. This gives us the equation FLYFLY = YY GG YY = BUGBUG. The only way this is true is if YY is a multiple of B and BUG is also a multiple of Y.
4. Let's try different values for F until we find a value that works. If F = 3, then the equation becomes 3LY3LY = YY GG YY = BUGBUG. In this case, Y must be less than 5 because if it were 5 or more, YY would be at least 50, and there is no digit for G that could work.
5. Let's try Y = 4. This gives us the equation 34G34G = BUGBUG. Since G must be less than B and B cannot be zero, the smallest possible value for B is 1. However, this would mean that the left side of the equation is larger than the right side, which is not allowed.
6. Therefore, let's try Y = 3. This gives us the equation 33G33G = BUGBUG. Since G must be less than or equal to 3 and B must be greater than 3, the only option for B is 5. This results in the equation 335335 = 55G55G.
7. By inspection, we can see that G = 1. This gives us FLYFLY = 331331 and BUGBUG = 551551.
8. Finally, to find the value of FLY + BUG, we add the two numbers together: (3 * 100000) + (3 * 1000) + (1 * 100) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 1) = 30301 and (5 * 100000) + (5 * 1000) + (1 * 100) + (5 * 10) + (1 * 1) = 50501.
9. Adding these two numbers together gives us FLY + BUG = $$ 80802 $$.

To solve for F, L, Y, B, U, G such that FLYFLY = BUGBUG and represent distinct digits, let's follow a step-by-step approach based on the given problem.

1. **Understanding the Structure**:
   - The number FLYFLY is a six-digit number where the first three digits are identical to the last three digits.
   - Therefore, FLYFLY can be represented as \( \overline{F L Y} \times 10^3 + \overline{F L Y} = \overline{F L Y} (1000 + 1) = \overline{F L Y} \cdot 1001 \).
   - Since FLYFLY is equal to BUGBUG, this implies that:
     \[
     \overline{F L Y} \cdot 1001 = \overline{B U G}
     \]

2. **Factors of 1001**:
   - First, let's factorize 1001: 
     \[
     1001 = 7 \times 143 = 7 \times (11 \times 13) = 7 \times 11 \times 13
     \]
   - Thus, \( 1001 = 7 \times 11 \times 13 \).

3. **Identifying Valid Combinations**:
   - The factors of 1001 are 7, 11, and 13. We need to determine which combination can form the digits F, L, Y, B, U, G such that all are distinct.

4. **Testing Possible Values**:
   - If we test with \( \overline{F L Y} = 127 \):
     \[
     127 \times 1001 = 127 \times (10^3 + 1) = 12700 + 127 = 12827
     \]
   - Checking if FLYFLY is equal to BUGBUG with the digits:
     \[
     12700 + 127 = 12827 
     \]
     And we check for valid B, U, G. Suppose \( \overline{B U G} = 12827 \):
     - For distinct digits: \( B = 1 \), \( U = 2 \), and \( G = 8 \).

5. **Verification**:
   - FLYFLY = 127127
   - BUGBUG = 128281
   - Clearly, these do not match since the digits are distinct but there is a need for verification.
   
6. **Correct Combinations**:
   - Consider another possibility: \( \overline{F L Y} = 759 \):
     \[
     759 \times 1001 = 759 \times (10^3 + 1) = 75900 + 759 = 76659
     \]
   - Suppose \( \overline{B U G} = 76659 \):
     - Valid B, U, G: \( B = 7 \), \( U = 6 \), and \( G = 5 \).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - FLYFLY = 759759
   - BUGBUG = 766597

8. **Summing the Numbers**:
   - Sum: 
     \[
     FLY + BUG = 759759 + 766597 = 1526356
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1526356}

     127 \times 1001 = 127 \times (10^3 + 1) = 12700 + 127 = 12827
     \]
   - Checking if FLYFLY is equal to BUGBUG with the digits:
     \[
     12700 + 127 = 12827 
     \]
     And we check for valid B, U, G. Suppose \( \overline{B U G} = 12827 \):
     - For distinct digits: \( B = 1 \), \( U = 2 \), and \( G = 8 \).

5. **Verification**:
   - FLYFLY = 127127
   - BUGBUG = 128281
   - Clearly, these do not match since the digits are distinct but there is a need for verification.
   
6. **Correct Combinations**:
   - Consider another possibility: \( \overline{F L Y} = 759 \):
     \[
     759 \times 1001 = 759 \times (10^3 + 1) = 75900 + 759 = 76659
     \]
   - Suppose \( \overline{B U G} = 76659 \):
     - Valid B, U, G: \( B = 7 \), \( U = 6 \), and \( G = 5 \).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - FLYFLY = 759759
   - BUGBUG = 766597

8. **Summing the Numbers**:
   - Sum: 
     \[
     FLY + BUG = 759759 + 766597 = 1526356
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1526356}

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: Minh enters the numbers 1 through 81 into the cells of a 9x9 grid in some order. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. What is the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the problem**: Minh enters numbers from 1 to 81 into a 9x9 grid. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. We need to find the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.

2. **Factorization and divisibility rule**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. This means we need at least one multiple of 3 in each row or column for the product to be divisible by 3.

3. **Counting multiples of 3**: There are 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, ..., 81). Since there are 9 rows and 9 columns, we have a total of 18 lines.

4. **Minimum number of lines with product divisible by 3**: We need to distribute these 27 multiples among the 18 lines (rows + columns) such that at least one line in each row and column has a product divisible by 3.

5. **Distributing multiples of 3**: If we distribute the multiples as evenly as possible, we can put 2 multiples of 3 into 9 lines, which would make the product of at least one number in each line divisible by 3. This is because there are 27 multiples and 18 lines, so each line would have at least 2 multiples of 3 on average.

6. **Final answer**: Therefore, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is $\boxed{9}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Understand the Problem**: Minh enters numbers from 1 to 81 into a 9x9 grid and calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. We need to find the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.

2. **Identify Multiples of 3**: A product is divisible by 3 if it contains at least one multiple of 3 or three factors of 1 (since $1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1$). We need to identify how many numbers from 1 to 81 are multiples of 3.
   - The multiples of 3 between 1 and 81 are: 3, 6, 9, ..., 81. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a = 3$, common difference $d = 3$, and last term $l = 81$.
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a + (n-1)d$. Setting $a_n = 81$, we solve for $n$:
     \[
     81 = 3 + (n-1) \times 3 \implies 78 = 3(n-1) \implies n-1 = 26 \implies n = 27
     \]
   - So, there are 27 multiples of 3 between 1 and 81.

3. **Consider the Grid**: Since each row and column has 9 numbers, and there are 27 multiples of 3, some rows and columns will contain these multiples. We need to ensure that at least 6 rows and columns have a product divisible by 3.

4. **Distribute Multiples of 3**: To minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3, we can distribute the multiples of 3 such that each row and column contains exactly one multiple of 3. This ensures that every row and column has at least one factor of 3 in its product.

5. **Conclusion**: Since each of the 9 rows and 9 columns must contain at least one multiple of 3 to ensure the product is divisible by 3, and we have exactly 27 multiples of 3 to distribute, it follows that every row and column will contain a multiple of 3.

Thus, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is $\boxed{9}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to understand how many times a number between 1 and 81 is divisible by 3. This can be calculated using the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer. So, we calculate $\lfloor\frac{81}{3}\rfloor=27$.
2. Next, we consider the case where each of the 9 rows has a product that is divisible by 3. This means that each row must have at least one number that is divisible by 3. However, there are only 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are divisible by 3. So, it's impossible for all 9 rows to have a product that is divisible by 3.
3. Therefore, we need to find the minimum number of rows (and columns) where this is possible. We know that there are 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are divisible by 3.
4. If we divide these 27 numbers among 6 rows (and 6 columns), each row would have at least $\lfloor\frac{27}{6}\rfloor=4$ numbers divisible by 3. This means that the product of the numbers in each row (and column) would be divisible by $3^4=81$, which is divisible by 3.
5. So, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{6}$.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the least number of rows and columns that have a product divisible by 3 in a 9x9 grid where numbers from 1 to 81 are placed.
   - A number is divisible by 3 if its product with another number also contains at least one factor of 3.

2. **Factorization**:
   - The multiples of 3 between 1 and 81 are: \( \{3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots, 81\} \).
   - Count the multiples of 3 in this range using arithmetic progression properties. 
   - There are 27 such numbers.

3. **Distributing Multiples**:
   - We need to place these 27 multiples across a grid of 9 rows and 9 columns.
   - If we distribute them evenly, each row and column could potentially contain at least one multiple of 3 because \( \left\lfloor \frac{27}{9} \right\rfloor = 3 \).
   
4. **Checking Minimum**:
   - The goal is to find the smallest number of rows and columns that together have all these multiples, so their product is divisible by 3.
   - If we consider a scenario where each row has at least one multiple of 3 (as distributing evenly would mean this), we look at having at most 6 rows or 6 columns since \( \left\lceil \frac{27}{9} \right\rceil = 3 \).
   - For example, if every third row and column contained all multiples, then ensuring divisibility by 3 across a minimal number of lines would be necessary.

5. **Example Distribution**:
   - If we place 4 multiples in some rows and columns such that each contains at least one multiple, the minimum would be covering exactly half (rounded up). 
   - We can distribute them as \( \left\lceil \frac{27}{9} \right\rceil = 3 \) for rows or columns.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - If we have each row and column containing at least one multiple of three, the minimum count is indeed fewer than all (i.e., 6 instead of all).

Thus, the least number of rows and columns that could contain a product divisible by 3 is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]

This solution aligns with ensuring divisibility across necessary minimal distribution.

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers. Three fifths of the pairs are red and the rest are white. Two thirds of the pairs are high-top and the rest are low-top. The red high-top sneakers make up a fraction of the collection. What is the least possible value of this fraction?

Using exemplars:
1. Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers.
2. Three fifths (3/5) of these pairs are red, so 3/5 * 15 = 9 pairs are red.
3. The rest of the pairs are white, so 15 - 9 = 6 pairs are white.
4. Two thirds (2/3) of the pairs are high-top, so 2/3 * 15 = 10 pairs are high-top.
5. The rest of the pairs are low-top, so 15 - 10 = 5 pairs are low-top.
6. To find the fraction of red high-top sneakers, we need to determine how many pairs are both red and high-top. Since there are only 9 red pairs and 10 high-top pairs, at most 9 of them can be red and high-top (since there can't be more red high-top pairs than total red pairs).
7. Therefore, the least possible value for the fraction of red high-top sneakers is 9/15 = $$3/5$$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are red. Three fifths of Jordan's collection is red, so we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) pairs of red sneakers.
2. Next, we determine how many pairs of sneakers are high-top. Two thirds of the collection is high-top, so we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10 \) pairs of high-top sneakers.
3. Now, we want to find the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection. To minimize this fraction, we maximize the number of non-red, non-high-top sneakers.
4. Since 9 pairs are red and 10 pairs are high-top, there must be at least \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) pairs of white sneakers (because at least 6 pairs are not red) and at least \( 15 - 10 = 5 \) pairs of low-top sneakers (because at least 5 pairs are not high-top).
5. Therefore, the maximum number of non-red, non-high-top sneakers is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) pairs. This means there are \( 15 - 11 = 4 \) pairs that could be red high-top sneakers.
6. Thus, the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection is \( \frac{4}{15} \).
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are red and white. Since three fifths of Jordan's sneakers are red, we calculate:
   Number of red pairs = (3/5) * Total number of pairs
   = (3/5) * 15
   = 9 pairs

2. This means that the rest of the sneakers must be white. So, the number of white pairs is:
   Number of white pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of red pairs
   = 15 - 9
   = 6 pairs

3. Next, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are high-top and low-top. Since two thirds of Jordan's sneakers are high-top, we calculate:
   Number of high-top pairs = (2/3) * Total number of pairs
   = (2/3) * 15
   = 10 pairs

4. This means that the rest of the sneakers must be low-top. So, the number of low-top pairs is:
   Number of low-top pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of high-top pairs
   = 15 - 10
   = 5 pairs

5. Now, we need to find out how many red high-top sneakers there are. Since all the high-top sneakers could be white (the least possible), the number of red high-top sneakers is:
   Number of red high-top pairs = Minimum(Number of red pairs, Number of high-top pairs)
   = Minimum(9, 10)
   = 9 pairs

6. Finally, we can find out what fraction of the total collection these 9 pairs represent:
   Fraction of red high-top sneakers = Number of red high-top pairs / Total number of pairs
   = 9 / 15
   = 3/5

So, the least possible value for the fraction is $\boxed{3/5}$.

To find the least possible value for the fraction of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of pairs:** 15

2. **Number of red pairs:**
   - Three fifths (3/5) of the pairs are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red pairs} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of white pairs:**
   - The rest of the pairs are white.
   \[

6. To find the least possible value for the fraction of red high-top sneakers, we need to maximize the number of non-red and non-high-top sneakers. 

7. The maximum number of white pairs (which are neither red nor high-top) is 6.
8. Since there are only 10 high-top pairs in total, at most 9 of these can be red (since all red pairs must still fit into the red category).
   
   - Number of red high-top sneakers = Minimum(Number of red pairs, Number of high-top pairs)
   \[
   \text{Number of red high-top pairs} = \min(9, 10) = 9
   \]

9. The least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers is therefore:
\[
\text{Fraction of red high-top sneakers} = \frac{\text{Number of red high-top pairs}}{\text{Total number of pairs}} = \frac{9}{15} = \frac{3}{5}

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: A group of frogs (called an army) is living in a tree. A frog turns green when in the shade and turns yellow when in the sun. Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. Now the ratio is 4:1. What is the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now?

Using exemplars:
1. We start by letting the initial number of green frogs be $3x$ and the initial number of yellow frogs be $x$. This is because the ratio of green to yellow frogs was initially given as 3:1.

2. After the movement, there are three more yellow frogs than green frogs on the shady side. This can be represented as $(3x + 5) - (3x - 3)$.

3. Similarly, for the sunny side, there are fewer yellow frogs than green frogs by two. This can be represented as $x - (3x + 5)$.

4. The problem states that after the movement, the ratio of green to yellow frogs is now 4:1. So, we can set up the equation $(3x - 3) : (x - (3x + 5)) = 4 : 1$. This simplifies to $3x - 3 : (-2x - 5) = 4 : 1$.

5. Solving this proportion, we get $-2x - 5 = \frac{1}{4}(3x - 3)$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 6$.

6. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the current number of green frogs by substituting $x$ into $(3x - 3)$, which gives us $15$.

7. The current number of yellow frogs is $2x + 5$, which, when we substitute $x = 6$, gives us $17$.

8. Finally, to find the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now, we subtract the number of green frogs from the number of yellow frogs, which is $17 - 15 = 2$.

So, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is $\boxed{2}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the initial number of green frogs as G and the initial number of yellow frogs as Y. According to the problem, the initial ratio is 3:1, so we can write this relationship as G/Y = 3/1 or G = 3Y.

2. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. This changes the number of frogs in each group to G - 3 and Y + 5 respectively.

3. Now, the ratio is 4:1, so we can write this relationship as (G - 3)/(Y + 5) = 4/1 or G - 3 = 4(Y + 5).

4. We now have two equations with two variables: G = 3Y and G - 3 = 4(Y + 5).

5. Substitute the first equation into the second to get 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5), which simplifies to Y = 18.

6. Substitute Y back into the first equation to get G = 3*18 = 54.

7. Now we know that there are 54 green frogs and 18 yellow frogs. The difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs is 54 - 18 = 36.

The final answer is \boxed{36}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Initially, let's assume there are x green frogs and y yellow frogs in the tree. We know that the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1, so we can write an equation as follows:
x/y = 3/1
2. Solving for x gives us:
x = 3y
3. Then, 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. After moving, the number of green frogs became (x-3) and the number of yellow frogs became (y+5). We know that now the ratio is 4:1, so we can write another equation as follows:
(x-3)/(y+5) = 4/1
4. Substituting x=3y into this equation gives us:
(3y - 3)/(y + 5) = 4/1
5. Solving for y gives us:
y = 2
6. Then, substituting y=2 into the equation x=3y gives us:
x = 3 * 2 = 6
7. Now, we can find the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs after moving as follows:
Difference = (x-3) - (y+5)
8. Substituting x=6 and y=2 into this equation gives us:
Difference = (6-3) - (2+5)
9. Simplifying this equation gives us:
Difference = 3 - 7 = -4
10. Therefore, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is -4.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{-4} $$

Let's denote:
- The initial number of green frogs by \( G \).
- The initial number of yellow frogs by \( Y \).

From the problem, we know that initially the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. Therefore,
\[ \frac{G}{Y} = 3 \]
This implies
\[ G = 3Y \]

After some time:
- 3 green frogs moved from the shady side (green) to the sunny side.
- 5 yellow frogs moved from the sunny side (yellow) to the shady side.

Let \( x \) be the initial number of green frogs and \( y \) be the initial number of yellow frogs. Thus, after the movements:
- The number of green frogs becomes \( G - 3 = 3Y - 3 \).
- The number of yellow frogs becomes \( Y + 5 = y + 5 \).

We also know that the new ratio of green to yellow frogs is now 4:1. Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{G - 3}{Y + 5} = 4 \]

Substituting \( G = 3Y \) into this equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3Y - 3}{Y + 5} = 4 \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]

Rearranging the terms:
\[ 3Y - 4Y = 20 + 3 \]
\[ -Y = 23 \]
\[ Y = -23 \]

Since \( Y \) represents an initial number of frogs, which must be non-negative, there seems to be a mistake. Let's recheck the steps and solve for \( x \) again.

Substituting \( G = 3Y \) into:
\[ \frac{3Y - 3}{Y + 5} = 4 \]

We simplify:
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]

Rearranging terms correctly:
\[ 3Y - 4Y = 20 + 3 \]
\[ -Y = 23 \]
\[ Y = -23 \] (incorrect, should be positive)

Rechecking the equation setup: 
Given \( G = 3Y \) and new ratio:
\[ \frac{3Y - 3}{Y + 5} = 4 \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]
\[ 3Y - 4Y = 20 + 3 \]
\[ -Y = 23 \]
This contradiction suggests a need for rechecking initial setup and constraints.

Let’s solve using correct substitution:
Given \( G = 3Y \):
\[ \frac{3Y - 3}{Y + 5} = 4 \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]
\[ 3Y - 4Y = 20 + 3 \]
\[ -Y = 23 \] (incorrect, should be positive)

Re-solving with correct initial \( Y \):
Given:
\[ G = 3Y \]
Let's correctly solve by rechecking setup:

If \( x = 6 \), then solving correctly yields:
\[ Y = 18 \]
\( G = 54 - 27 = 27\)

Therefore, difference is:
\[ 27 - 18 = 9 \]

Thus the final answer is:
$$ \boxed{9} $$

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: A small airplane has 4 rows of seats with 3 seats in each row. Eight passengers have boarded the plane and are distributed randomly among the seats. A married couple is next to board. What is the probability there will be 2 adjacent seats in the same row for the couple?

Using exemplars:
1. **Total number of ways the couple can sit**: The total number of ways to place the couple in any two seats is equal to the number of pairs of seats available on the plane.
2. **Number of favorable outcomes (2 adjacent seats)**: This depends on how we define "adjacent" - are they adjacent in the same row or across rows? For simplicity, let's assume we mean adjacent in the same row. There are 4 rows with 3 seats each, so there are 3 pairs of adjacent seats in each row, and a total of $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ pairs of adjacent seats on the plane.
3. **Calculating the probability**: The probability that the couple sits next to each other is then $\frac{12}{15} = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify the total number of ways to seat the eight passengers:** Since there are four rows with three seats each, and eight passengers, we first calculate the number of ways to arrange these passengers in the seats. This is a permutation problem, where order matters. We have 12 seats and 8 passengers, so the number of arrangements is given by the permutation formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items to choose from, and r is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 12 (seats) and r = 8 (passengers).
   \[
   \text{Total arrangements} = P(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{(12-8)!} = \frac{12!}{4!}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to place the married couple:** The couple can be placed in any two adjacent seats in a row. Since there are 3 seats in each row, and they must sit next to each other, we treat them as a single entity first. This leaves us with 7 entities to arrange (the couple and the other 6 passengers). We now have 10 slots (4 rows * 3 seats/row - 2 seats occupied by the couple) to place these 7 entities. The number of ways to do this is given by P(10, 7).
   \[
   \text{Arrangements for the couple} = P(10, 7) = \frac{10!}{(10-7)!} = \frac{10!}{3!}
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:** The probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible arrangements.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Arrangements for the couple}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{P(10, 7)}{P(12, 8)} = \frac{\frac{10!}{3!}}{\frac{12!}{4!}}
   \]

4. **Simplify and calculate:** Simplifying the expression gives us the probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{10!}{3!}}{\frac{12!}{4!}} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5} = \frac{3}{11}
   \]

5. **Final answer:** The probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other is $\boxed{\frac{3}{11}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the eight passengers. Since there are 4 rows and each row has 3 seats, there are a total of 12 seats (4 * 3). The number of ways to choose 8 seats out of 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of arrangements is C(12, 8).

2. Next, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange the eight passengers such that the married couple has two adjacent seats in the same row. There are 4 rows, and for each row, there are 3 pairs of adjacent seats (since a row has only 3 seats). So, there are 12 possible positions for the married couple's seats.

3. Once the married couple's seats are fixed, the remaining 6 passengers can be arranged in the remaining 10 seats in C(10, 6) ways.

4. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes (arrangements where the married couple has two adjacent seats in the same row) is 12 * C(10, 6).

5. The probability that the married couple will have 2 adjacent seats in the same row is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability P = (12 * C(10, 6)) / C(12, 8).

Final answer: \boxed{P = (12 * C(10, 6)) / C(12, 8)}

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a newly boarding married couple can sit in two adjacent seats within the same row.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 passengers in 12 seats. This is given by the permutation formula \( P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \), where \( n = 12 \) and \( r = 8 \):

\[
P(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{4!}
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (ways in which a couple can sit next to each other within the same row). We have 4 rows with 3 seats each. In each row, there are 2 pairs of adjacent seats.

For simplicity, let's assume the arrangement is as follows:
1st Row: A B C
2nd Row: D E F
3rd Row: G H I
4th Row: J K L

We need to count how many ways a couple can sit in these adjacent pairs. For each row with 2 adjacent seats, there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways to choose which two of the three seats they occupy.

Since there are 4 rows and each row has 2 favorable configurations:
\[
\text{Total number of favorable outcomes for couples within a row} = 4 \times 6 = 24
\]

Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes (ways to have the couple in adjacent seats anywhere on the plane) is:

\[
\text{Total favorable arrangements} = 24
\]

Now, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable arrangements by the total possible arrangements:

The total number of ways to arrange 8 passengers in 12 seats is:
\[
P(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{4!}
\]

Simplify \( P(12, 8) \):
\[
P(12, 8) = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 11880
\]

Thus, the probability \( P \) that a couple can sit in adjacent seats within the same row is:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible arrangements}} = \frac{24}{11880}
\]

Simplify this fraction:
\[
P = \frac{24}{11880} = \frac{1}{495}
\]

Therefore, the probability that a newly boarding couple will sit in two adjacent seats within the same row is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{495}}

\]

Thus, the probability \( P \) that a couple can sit in adjacent seats within the same row is:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible arrangements}} = \frac{24}{11880}
\]

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: Wind chill is a measure of how cold people feel when exposed to wind outside. A good estimate for wind chill can be found using this calculation (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed) where temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed is measured in miles per hour (mph). Suppose the air temperature is 36 degrees F and the wind speed is 18 mph. Which of the following is closest to the approximate wind chill?

Using exemplars:
1. Identify the given values for the calculation: Air temperature = 36°F, Wind speed = 18 mph.
2. Plug these values into the wind chill formula: (Wind chill) = (36°F) - 0.7 * (18 mph).
3. Calculate the product of 0.7 and 18 mph, which is 12.6 mph.
4. Subtract this value from the air temperature: 36°F - 12.6 mph = 23.4°F.
5. Therefore, the approximate wind chill is $23.4°F$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We are given the formula for calculating wind chill: (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed).
2. Substitute the given values into the formula: Wind Chill = 36 - 0.7 * 18.
3. Multiply: Wind Chill = 36 - 12.6.
4. Subtract: Wind Chill = 23.4 degrees F.

Therefore, the approximate wind chill is $$ \boxed{23} $$ degrees Fahrenheit.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find the product of the wind speed and 0.7. So, $18 \times 0.7 = 12.6$
2. Then, subtract this result from the air temperature: $36 - 12.6 = 23.4$

To find the approximate wind chill, we will use the given formula:

\[
(wind \text{ chill}) = (air \text{ temperature}) - 0.7 \times (wind \text{ speed})
\]

Given values are:
- Air temperature = 36°F
- Wind speed = 18 mph

First, let's calculate \(0.7 \times 18\) miles per hour:

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: A lake contains 250 trout, along with a variety of other fish. When a marine biologist catches and releases a sample of 180 fish from the lake, 30 are identified as trout. Assume that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. How many fish are there in the lake?

Using exemplars:
1. We know that 30 out of the 180 fish caught by the marine biologist are trout, so the ratio of trout to total fish in the sample is 30/180.
2. Since we assume the ratio of trout to total fish is the same in both the sample and the lake, we can set up a proportion: (trout in sample) / (total fish in sample) = (trout in lake) / (total fish in lake). Plugging in the numbers gives us 30/180 = 250/(total fish in lake).
3. Solving for "total fish in lake", we get: total fish in lake = 250 * (180/30) = 1500.
4. Therefore, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{1500} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. This means that the proportion of trout in the sample should be equal to the proportion of trout in the entire lake.
2. We can express this relationship as a proportion: (number of trout in the sample / total number of fish in the sample) = (number of trout in the lake / total number of fish in the lake).
3. Substituting the given values into the proportion, we get: (30 / 180) = (250 / x), where x is the total number of fish in the lake.
4. Simplifying the left side of the equation gives us: (1/6) = (250 / x).
5. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and get: 250 * 6 = 1 * x.
6. This simplifies to: 1500 = x.
7. Therefore, the total number of fish in the lake is $$ \boxed{1500} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish in the sample is the same as in the lake. In the sample, there are 30 trout out of a total of 180 fish. So, the ratio is 30/180 = 1/6.
2. This means that for every 6 fish in the lake, one is a trout. Therefore, to find out how many fish there are in total in the lake, we need to multiply the number of trout by 6.
3. There are 250 trout in the lake. So, the total number of fish in the lake is 250 * 6 = 1500.

The final answer is $$ \boxed{1500} $$.

To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the ratio of trout to the total number of fish in the sampled group and apply it to the entire lake.

1. The proportion of trout in the sample is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Proportion of trout in sample} = \frac{\text{Number of trout in sample}}{\text{Total number of fish in sample}} = \frac{30}{180}
   \]
2. Simplifying this ratio, we get:
   \[
   \frac{30}{180} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

Since the proportion of trout is assumed to be the same for both the sample and the entire lake, the ratio in the lake will also be 1/6.

3. Let \( x \) represent the total number of fish in the lake.
4. The number of trout in the lake can be represented as a fraction of the total number of fish:
   \[
   \text{Proportion of trout in lake} = \frac{\text{Number of trout in lake}}{x}
   \]

Given that the ratio is 1/6, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of trout in lake}}{x} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Since there are 250 trout in the lake:
\[
\frac{250}{x} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
250 \times 6 = x \times 1

\[
x = 1500

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Harold made a plum pie to take on a picnic. He was able to eat only 1/4 of the pie, and he left the rest for his friends. A moose came by and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. After that, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. How much of the original pie still remained after the porcupine left?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how much pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate 1/4 of the pie, his friends got 3/4 of it.
2. Then, the moose came and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. So, the moose ate 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4 of the original pie.
3. After the moose, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. The moose had eaten 1/4 of the pie, so the porcupine ate 1/3 * 1/4 = 1/12 of the original pie.
4. To find out how much pie is left after the porcupine, we subtract what the moose and the porcupine ate from what Harold left behind: (3/4 - 1/4) - 1/12 = 1/2 - 1/12 = 6/12 - 1/12 = 5/12 of the original pie.

So, the final answer is \boxed{5/12}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's determine how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate 1/4 of the pie, the remaining fraction would be 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.
2. Next, we need to find out how much of the pie was left after the moose ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. So, we multiply the amount left by Harold (3/4) by 2/3 (since 1 - 1/3 = 2/3), which results in (3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2.
3. Finally, we need to calculate how much of the original pie was still remaining after the porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. To do this, we multiply the amount left by the moose (1/2) by 2/3 (since 1 - 1/3 = 2/3), which results in (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3.
4. Therefore, $$ \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} $$ of the original pie remained after the porcupine left.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate only 1/4 of it, his friends got the remaining 3/4 (because 1 - 1/4 = 3/4).
2. Next, let's calculate how much the moose ate from the leftovers. The moose ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind, which was 3/4 of the pie. So, the moose ate (1/3) * (3/4) = 9/12 = 3/4 of a pie.
3. After the moose ate, there was (3/4) - (3/4) = 0 left for Harold's friends.
4. Now, let's see how much the porcupine ate from what the moose left behind. The porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left, which is (1/3) * (3/4) = 9/12 = 3/4 of a pie.
5. Therefore, after all these events, there was no pie left for Harold's friends or any other animal because both Harold and the moose ate all of it.

To solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate how much of the pie Harold left for his friends**:
   - Harold ate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pie.
   - Therefore, what he left behind is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).

2. **Determine how much of the pie the moose ate**:
   - The moose ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what Harold left behind.
   - What was left after the moose: 
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the moose} = \frac{3}{4} - \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \right)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{3 \times 4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Subtract this from the initial amount left:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the moose} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much of the pie the porcupine ate**:
   - The porcupine ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what was left after the moose.
   - What was left after the porcupine:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the porcupine} = \frac{1}{2} - \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \right)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 1}{3 \times 2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]
   - Subtract this from what was left after the moose:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the porcupine} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}
     \]

4. **Finding a common denominator to subtract the fractions**:
   - Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}, \quad \text{so, } \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

So the amount of pie that still remains after the porcupine left is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
Answer: To solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate how much of the pie Harold left for his friends**:
   - Harold ate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pie.
   - Therefore, what he left behind is \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).

2. **Determine how much of the pie the moose ate**:
   - The moose ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what Harold left behind.
   - What was left after the moose: 
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the moose} = \frac{3}{4} - \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \right)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{3 \times 4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Subtract this from the initial amount left:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the moose} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much of the pie the porcupine ate**:
   - The porcupine ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what was left after the moose.
   - What was left after the porcupine:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the porcupine} = \frac{1}{2} - \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \right)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 1}{3 \times 2} = \frac{1}{6}
     \]
   - Subtract this from what was left after the moose:
     \[
     \text{Left for Harold's friends after the porcupine} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}
     \]

4. **Finding a common denominator to subtract the fractions**:
   - Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}, \quad \text{so, } \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

So the amount of pie that still remains after the porcupine left is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: NASA's Perseverance Rover was launched on July 30 2020 After traveling 292,526,838 miles, it landed on Mars in Jezero Crater about 6.5 months later. Which of the following is closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took for the Perseverance Rover to travel from Earth to Mars. It was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed on Mars on February 18,

21. That's a bit more than 6.5 months. To be exact, it's 7 months and 19 days.

2. Next, we convert this time into hours. We know that:
   - 1 month has approximately 30 days.
   - 1 day has 24 hours.

So, the total time in hours is (7 * 30 + 19) * 24 = 6456 hours.

3. Now, we can calculate the average speed of the rover by dividing the total distance it traveled by the total time it took. The rover traveled 292,526,838 miles in 6456 hours.

4. So, the average speed is 292,526,838 / 6456 = 45,308 miles per hour.

Therefore, the closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour is $\boxed{45,308}$ mph.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many hours it took for the rover to travel that distance. Since there are approximately 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows:
   Total hours = 6.5 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day
   = 4776 hours

2. Next, we divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to find the average speed in miles per hour:
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   = 292,526,838 miles / 4776 hours
   ≈ 61,262.6 miles/hour

So, the closest value to the Rover's average interplanetary speed is approximately $61,262.6$ miles per hour.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many hours have passed from July 30, 2020 to January 7, 2021 (about 6.5 months later). There are approximately 88 days in 6.5 months, and each day has 24 hours:

Days = 88
   Hours per Day = 24
   Total Hours = Days * Hours per Day
   = 88 * 24
   = 2112 hours

2. Next, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken:

Speed = Distance / Time
    = 292,526,838 miles / 2112 hours
    ≈ 138,564.78 miles per hour (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{138564.78} $$

To determine the average speed of the Perseverance Rover, we need to calculate how many hours it took for the rover to travel 292,526,838 miles. Given that the journey took about 6.5 months, we will convert this time into hours.

1. **Convert the duration from months to days:**
   - There are approximately \( 30 \) days in one month.
   - So, for 6.5 months, the total number of days is:
     \[
     6.5 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 195 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are \( 24 \) hours in one day.
   - Thus, for 195 days:
     \[
     195 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 4680 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - The total distance traveled is \( 292,526,838 \) miles.
   - Using the formula for average speed:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]
   - Plugging in our values:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{292,526,838 \text{ miles}}{4680 \text{ hours}}
     \]

   Performing the division gives:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} \approx 62,721.43 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, the closest value to the Rover's average interplanetary speed is approximately \( 62,721.43 \) miles per hour.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62721.43}

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps, with exactly 20 of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We have three types of stamps: 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps. Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type.

2. The goal is to find the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage.

3. To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of these three types of stamps that would add up to $7.10.

4. Let's start with the 25-cent stamp. If we use one 25-cent stamp, we still need $6.85 ($7.10 - $0.25).

5. Now, let's consider the 10-cent and 5-cent stamps. We can make $6.85 using two 25-cent stamps (which is not possible as we only have one), four 10-cent stamps ($0.40 * 4 = $1.60) and nine 5-cent stamps ($0.05 * 9 = $0.45). This makes a total of $2.05, which is less than $6.85.

6. If we use three 10-cent stamps instead of four, we get $1.20 ($0.40 * 3). Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.65, which is still less than $6.85.

7. If we use two 10-cent stamps, we get $0.80 ($0.40 * 2). Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.35, which is closer but still less than $6.85.

8. If we use one 10-cent stamp, we get $0.40. Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.05, which is still less than $6.85.

9. Therefore, the only way to make exactly $7.10 using these stamps is to use one 25-cent stamp and then fill the rest of the amount with 10-cent and 5-cent stamps.

10. So, we use one 25-cent stamp, four 10-cent stamps ($0.40 * 4 = $1.60), and nine 5-cent stamps ($0.05 * 9 = $0.45). This makes a total of $2.05 + $7.10 - $0.25 = $8.90, which is not equal to $7.10.

11. Therefore, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is 43 (1 * 25 + 4 * 10 + 9 * 5).

\boxed{43}
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of 5-cent stamps as x, 10-cent stamps as y, and 25-cent stamps as z. We know that Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp, so we have three equations:
x + y + z = 20 (total number of stamps)
   The cost equation is:
   0.05x + 0.1y + 0.25z = 7.10 (the total cost in cents)

2. We can simplify the equations by multiplying everything by 100 to get rid of decimals, which gives us:
5x + 10y + 25z = 710
   x + y + z = 20

3. Now let's try to maximize the number of stamps (x + y + z). From the first equation, we know that x, y, and z must all be less than or equal to 20. Let's start by using as many 5-cent stamps as possible:
   5x = 710 - 10y - 25z
   Since x must be an integer, we can only have integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5. The smallest such value is when y = 0 and z = 0, which gives us:
   5x = 710 - 10(0) - 25(0) = 710
   So x = 142, but this is not possible since x must be less than or equal to 20. Let's try the next smallest value for y and z:
   y = 1, z = 1 (so we use one 10-cent stamp and one 25-cent stamp)
   5x = 710 - 10(1) - 25(1) = 685
   So x = 137, but again this is not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

4. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 19 and z = 0 (so we use all 19 ten-cent stamps and no twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(19) - 25(0) = 695
   So x = 139, but again this is not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

5. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 19 and z = 1 (so we use all 19 ten-cent stamps and one twenty-five-cent stamp), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(19) - 25(1) = 665
   So x = 133, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

6. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 18 and z = 1 (so we use all 18 ten-cent stamps and one twenty-five-cent stamp), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(18) - 25(1) = 660
   So x = 132, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

7. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 18 and z = 2 (so we use all 18 ten-cent stamps and two twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(18) - 25(2) = 645
   So x = 129, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

8. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 17 and z = 3 (so we use all 17 ten-cent stamps and three twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(17) - 25(3) = 630
   So x = 126, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

9. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 17 and z = 4 (so we use all 17 ten-cent stamps and four twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(17) - 25(4) = 615
   So x = 123, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

10. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 16 and z = 5 (so we use all 16 ten-cent stamps and five twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(16) - 25(5) = 590
   So x = 118, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

11. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 16 and z = 6 (so we use all 16 ten-cent stamps and six twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(16) - 25(6) = 565
   So x = 113, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

12. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 15 and z = 7 (so we use all 15 ten-cent stamps and seven twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(15) - 25(7) = 530
   So x = 106, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

13. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 15 and z = 8 (so we use all 15 ten-cent stamps and eight twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(15) - 25(8) = 495
   So x = 99, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

14. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 14 and z = 9 (so we use all 14 ten-cent stamps and nine twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(14) - 25(9) = 450
   So x = 90, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

15. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 14 and z = 10 (so we use all 14 ten-cent stamps and ten twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(14) - 25(10) = 395
   So x = 79, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

16. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 13 and z = 11 (so we use all 13 ten-cent stamps and eleven twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(13) - 25(11) = 330
   So x = 66, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

17. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 13 and z = 12 (so we use all 13 ten-cent stamps and twelve twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(13) - 25(12) = 265
   So x = 53, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

18. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 12 and z = 13 (so we use all 12 ten-cent stamps and thirteen twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(12) - 25(13) = 190
   So x = 38, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

19. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 12 and z = 14 (so we use all 12 ten-cent stamps and fourteen twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
    5x = 710 - 10(12) - 25(14) = 95
   So x = 19, which is possible. We found that y = 12 and z = 14 satisfy the equation.

\boxed{19}
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify Variables:** Let's denote the number of 5-cent stamps as \(x\), 10-cent stamps as \(y\), and 25-cent stamps as \(z\).

2. **Set Up Equation:** The total value of all stamps Nicolas can use is $7.10, which translates to 710 cents. Therefore, the equation representing this scenario is:
   \[
   5x + 10y + 25z = 710
   \]

3. **Consider Constraints:** Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp, so \(x \leq 20\), \(y \leq 20\), and \(z \leq 20\). We need to find the maximum value of \(x + y + z\) under these constraints.

4. **Simplify Equation:** To simplify, we can divide the entire equation by 5:
   \[
   x + 2y + 5z = 142
   \]

5. **Maximize \(x + y + z\):** Since \(z\) is multiplied by 5 in the simplified equation, we should maximize \(z\) to get the largest possible \(x + y + z\). The maximum value of \(z\) is 20 (since Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp).

6. **Substitute and Solve:** Substituting \(z = 20\) into the simplified equation:
   \[
   x + 2y + 5(20) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 100 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 42
   \]

7. **Maximize \(x + y\):** Since \(x \leq 20\) and \(y \leq 20\), we need to find the maximum value of \(x + y\) that satisfies \(x + 2y = 42\). The maximum value occurs when \(x = 20\) (since increasing \(x\) decreases \(y\) but does not exceed its limit).

8. **Final Calculation:** Substituting \(x = 20\) into \(x + 2y = 42\):
   \[
   20 + 2y = 42 \implies 2y = 22 \implies y = 11
   \]

9. **Sum Up Stamps:** The total number of stamps used is:
   \[
   x + y + z = 20 + 11 + 20 = 51
   \]

Therefore, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is \(\boxed{51}\).

To determine the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use to pay exactly $7.10 (which is equivalent to 710 cents), we start by setting up the equation for the total value of the stamps:

\[
5x + 10y + 25z = 710
\]

where \( x \) represents the number of 5-cent stamps, \( y \) represents the number of 10-cent stamps, and \( z \) represents the number of 25-cent stamps. Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp (5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent), so we have the constraints:

\[
x \leq 20, \quad y \leq 20, \quad z \leq 20
\]

We need to find the values of \( x, y, \) and \( z \) that satisfy these conditions and maximize their sum. First, let's simplify the equation by dividing through by 5:

\[
x + 2y + 5z = 142
\]

To maximize \( x + y + z \), we should consider different values for \( z \):

### Case Analysis for \( z \)

#### \( z = 20 \)
If \( z = 20 \), then the equation becomes:
\[
x + 2y + 5(20) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 100 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 42
\]

Given \( y \leq 20 \), we solve for \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 42 \implies x + 40 = 42 \implies x = 2
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 2 + 20 + 20 = 42 \).

If \( y < 20 \), then:
\[
x + 2y < 42
\]
Since \( x \leq 20 \) and \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum sum \( x + y + z \) is still less than or equal to \( 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \).

#### \( z < 20 \)
Let's consider smaller values of \( z \):

For \( z = 19 \):
\[
x + 2y + 5(19) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 95 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 47
\]
Given \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum value of \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 47 \implies x + 40 = 47 \implies x = 7
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 7 + 20 + 19 = 46 \).

For \( z = 18 \):
\[
x + 2y + 5(18) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 90 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 52
\]
Given \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum value of \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 52 \implies x + 40 = 52 \implies x = 12
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 12 + 20 + 18 = 50 \).

For smaller values of \( z \), the sums \( x + y + z \) would be even lower. Therefore, the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use is when:

\[
x = 7, y = 20, z = 19
\]

Thus, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use is:
\[
\boxed{46}
\]
Answer: To determine the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use to pay exactly $7.10 (which is equivalent to 710 cents), we start by setting up the equation for the total value of the stamps:

\[
5x + 10y + 25z = 710

where \( x \) represents the number of 5-cent stamps, \( y \) represents the number of 10-cent stamps, and \( z \) represents the number of 25-cent stamps. Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp (5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent), so we have the constraints:

\[
x \leq 20, \quad y \leq 20, \quad z \leq 20
\]

We need to find the values of \( x, y, \) and \( z \) that satisfy these conditions and maximize their sum. First, let's simplify the equation by dividing through by 5:

\[
x + 2y + 5z = 142
\]

To maximize \( x + y + z \), we should consider different values for \( z \):

### Case Analysis for \( z \)

#### \( z = 20 \)
If \( z = 20 \), then the equation becomes:
\[
x + 2y + 5(20) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 100 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 42
\]

Given \( y \leq 20 \), we solve for \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 42 \implies x + 40 = 42 \implies x = 2
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 2 + 20 + 20 = 42 \).

If \( y < 20 \), then:
\[
x + 2y < 42
\]
Since \( x \leq 20 \) and \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum sum \( x + y + z \) is still less than or equal to \( 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \).

#### \( z < 20 \)
Let's consider smaller values of \( z \):

For \( z = 19 \):
\[
x + 2y + 5(19) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 95 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 47
\]
Given \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum value of \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 47 \implies x + 40 = 47 \implies x = 7
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 7 + 20 + 19 = 46 \).

For \( z = 18 \):
\[
x + 2y + 5(18) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 90 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 52
\]
Given \( y \leq 20 \), the maximum value of \( y \):

If \( y = 20 \):
\[
x + 2(20) = 52 \implies x + 40 = 52 \implies x = 12
\]
Thus, \( x + y + z = 12 + 20 + 18 = 50 \).

For smaller values of \( z \), the sums \( x + y + z \) would be even lower. Therefore, the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use is when:

\[
x = 7, y = 20, z = 19
\]

Thus, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use is:
\[

The maximum number of white pairs (which are neither red nor high-top) is 6.\n8. Since there are only 10 high-top pairs in total, at most 9 of these can be red (since all red pairs must still fit into the red category).\n   \n   - Number of red high-top sneakers = Minimum(Number of red pairs, Number of high-top pairs)\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of red high-top pairs} = \\min(9, 10) = 9\n   \\]\n\n9. The least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers is therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of red high-top sneakers} = \\frac{\\text{Number of red high-top pairs}}{\\text{Total number of pairs}} = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, the least possible value for this fraction is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\n$$",
