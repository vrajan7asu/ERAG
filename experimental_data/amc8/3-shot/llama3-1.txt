Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the ones digit of: 222,222 - 22,222 - 2,222 - 222 - 22 - 2?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by subtracting the largest number from the smallest: $222 - 2 = 220$.
2. Next, subtract $2$ from the result of step 1: $220 - 2 = 218$.
3. Continue this process for each subsequent pair of numbers:
   - Subtract $22$ from the result of step 2: $218 - 22 = 196$.
   - Subtract $222$ from the result of step 3: $196 - 222 = -26$.
   - Subtract $2,222$ from the result of step 4: $-26 - 2,222 = -2,248$.
   - Subtract $22,222$ from the result of step 5: $-2,248 - 22,222 = -24,470$.
4. Finally, subtract $222,222$ from the result of step 6: $-24,470 - 222,222 = -246,692$.
5. The question asks for the ones digit of the final result. To find this, we can simply look at the last digit of $-246,692$, which is $2$.

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: What is the value of this expression in decimal form? 44/11 + 110/44 + 44/1100

Using exemplars:
1. First, we can simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For 44/11, the GCD is 11; for 110/44, the GCD is 22; and for 44/1100, the GCD is

22. Doing this, we get:
   - 44/11 becomes 4/1
   - 110/44 becomes 5/2
   - 44/1100 becomes 1/25

2. Now, we can add these simplified fractions together. Since they all have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before adding them. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50. So, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 50:
   - 4/1 becomes 200/50
   - 5/2 becomes 125/50
   - 1/25 becomes 2/50

3. Now that all the fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together: (200 + 125 + 2) / 50 = 327/50

4. Finally, we convert this fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 327 ÷ 50 = 6.54

\boxed{6.54}
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's simplify the fractions 44/11 and 110/44:
   44/11 = 4 (since 44 divided by 11 equals 4)
   110/44 = 2.5 (since 110 divided by 44 equals 2.5 or 2 and a half)

2. Next, let's simplify the fraction 44/1100:
   Since 44 is not divisible by 1100, we can't simplify this fraction further.

3. Now, let's add these fractions together:
   4 + 2.5 + 44/1100

4. To make the addition easier, let's convert 4 to a decimal by dividing it by 1 (since any number divided by 1 equals itself):
   So, 4 = 4.0

5. Now, let's add these decimals together:
   4.0 + 2.5 + 0.04 (which is the decimal form of 44/1100)

6. Finally, let's add these numbers together to get the total sum:
   4.0 + 2.5 + 0.04 = 6.54

So, the value of the expression in decimal form is $$ \boxed{6.54} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Simplify each term of the expression:
   - The first term is 44/11, which simplifies to 4.
   - The second term is 110/44, which simplifies to 2.5.
   - The third term is 44/1100, which simplifies to 0.04.

2. Add the simplified terms together:
   - 4 + 2.5 + 0.04 = 6.54

3. Express the final answer in the required format:
   - $$ \boxed{6.54} $$

Here's the solution:

1. First, let's simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For 44/11, the GCD is 11; for 110/44, the GCD is 22; and for 44/1100, the GCD is 4.

   - 44/11 becomes 4/1
   - 110/44 becomes 5/2
   - 44/1100 becomes 11/275

2. Now, we can add these simplified fractions together. Since they all have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before adding them. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 275 is 550. So, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 550:
   - 4/1 becomes 2200/550
   - 5/2 becomes 1375/550
   - 11/275 becomes 44/550

3. Now that all the fractions have the same denominator, we can add them together: (2200 + 1375 + 44) / 550 = 3619/550

4. Finally, we convert this fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3619 ÷ 550 ≈ 6.57

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: When Yunji added all the integers from 1 to 9, she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9. We know that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, n = 9, a = 1, and l =

9. So, the total sum is 9/2 * (1 + 9) = 45.

2. Next, we need to find a square number that is less than or equal to 45, since Yunji's incorrect sum must be a square number and she left out a number. The possible square numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. However, 49 is not less than or equal to 45, so we can eliminate it.

3. Now, let's find the number that Yunji left out by subtracting each possible square number from the total sum of 45 and checking if the result is an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If such a number exists, then it must be the number Yunji left out.

- Subtracting 1 from 45 gives 44, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 4 from 45 gives 41, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 9 from 45 gives 36, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 16 from 45 gives 29, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 25 from 45 gives 20, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- However, subtracting 36 from 45 gives 9, which is an integer between 1 and 9.

Therefore, the number that Yunji left out must be 36, because her incorrect sum was a square number (36), and when we add this number back to the sum, we get the correct total sum of all integers from 1 to 9.

$$ \boxed{36} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the sum of all integers from 1 to 9 without leaving any number out. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (n/2) * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.
   Sum = (9/2) * (1 + 9) = 45

2. Next, we need to find a square number that is less than 45. The largest perfect square less than 45 is 36 (which is 6^2).

3. If Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then the number she left out would be the difference between the correct sum and her incorrect sum: 45 - 36 = 9.

So, $$ \boxed{9} $$ is the answer. Yunji must have left out the number 9.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 9. This is an arithmetic series with n=9, a_1=1, and a_n=

9. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S_n = n*(a_1+a_n)/2. Plugging in our values, we get:
   S_9 = 9 * (1 + 9) / 2 = 45

2. Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number. The closest square numbers to 45 are 36 and 49. Since 45 is between these two squares, the missing number must be one of them.

3. If the missing number was 36, then the sum of the integers from 1 to 8 would be:
   S_8 = 8 * (1 + 8) / 2 = 36
   Adding back the missing number gives us a total of 72, which is not equal to 45.

4. If the missing number was 49, then the sum of the integers from 1 to 10 would be:
   S_10 = 10 * (1 + 10) / 2 = 55
   Subtracting back the missing number gives us a total of 55 - 49 = 6, which is equal to 45.

5. Therefore, Yunji left out the number 49.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{49} $$

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9**

We know that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, n = 9, a = 1, and l = 9.

Sum = (9/2) * (1 + 9)
= 4.5 * 10
= 45

**Step 2: Find a square number that is less than or equal to 45**

The possible square numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36. Since 49 is not less than or equal to 45, we can eliminate it.

However, we need to find the largest perfect square that is less than 45. In this case, it's 36 (which is 6^2).

**Step 3: Find the number that Yunji left out**

If Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then the number she left out would be the difference between the correct sum and her incorrect sum:

Correct sum = 45
Incorrect sum = 36

Number left out = Correct sum - Incorrect sum
= 45 - 36
= 9

However, we know that Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number. If she left out the number 9, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake, as 36 is already included in this sum)

But wait! The correct sum of all integers from 1 to 9 is indeed 45. And if Yunji left out the number 9, her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake)

In this case, we should check another possible square number.

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 25. If Yunji left out the number 25, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution.

**Step 4: Find another square number**

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 16. If Yunji left out the number 16, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake)

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution either.

**Step 5: Find another square number**

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 9. But wait! We already know that Yunji left out the number 9.

So let's try another square number: 1. If Yunji left out the number 1, then her sum would be:
Sum = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
= 44 (not a mistake)

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution either.

**Step 6: Find another square number**

Let's try another square number: 25. But wait! We already know that Yunji left out the number 25 doesn't make sense in this context.

In fact, we should check if any of the smaller perfect squares (such as 1 or 4) can be subtracted from 45 to get a sum between 1 and 9. 

Let's see what happens when we try:

- Subtracting 1 from 45 gives 44, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 4 from 45 gives 41, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- But subtracting the square number 9 from 45 gives 36, which is a perfect square. However, we already know that Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number.

However, when we try to subtract another possible perfect square:

- Subtracting 16 from 45 gives 29, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- And if we subtract the next larger perfect square: 
- Subtracting 25 from 45 gives 20, which is also not an integer between 1 and 9.

But wait! Let's try another possible square number.

Let's subtract another perfect square that could be less than or equal to 45:

- And if we subtract the largest perfect square less than or equal to 45 (which we already checked):
   - Subtracting 36 from 45 gives 9, which is indeed a perfect square.

Therefore, Yunji must have left out the number 25 doesn't work. 

We should check another possible solution:


In fact, if Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then she wouldn't be making an error; however, this isn’t what happened.


If we let the incorrect sum be less than or equal to 45 and is a perfect square:


The number left out is indeed the difference between 45 and 36: which doesn’t make sense here.


In fact, if Yunji's incorrect sum was 25 (which we already tried), she would have only added up all integers from 1 through 8. However, this isn't what happened either.

However, in the original problem statement it said that Yunji’s sum is incorrect because it equals a perfect square number.


But since the largest square number less than or equal to 45 (which was already checked) was indeed 36:


Then if we want to try another possible solution:


If Yunji's incorrect sum was 16, then she wouldn’t be making an error; however, this isn’t what happened.



However, when we check all the other square numbers that are less than or equal to 45:


We find that there is indeed a perfect square number between 1 and 9 (which wasn't checked):


Which indeed equals 25.


If Yunji’s sum was 25 instead of 36:


Then she would have only left out one number: 

Which, in this case, must be the missing integer.
Answer: Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9**

We know that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, n = 9, a = 1, and l = 9.

Sum = (9/2) * (1 + 9)
= 4.5 * 10
= 45

**Step 2: Find a square number that is less than or equal to 45**

The possible square numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36. Since 49 is not less than or equal to 45, we can eliminate it.

However, we need to find the largest perfect square that is less than 45. In this case, it's 36 (which is 6^2).

**Step 3: Find the number that Yunji left out**

If Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then the number she left out would be the difference between the correct sum and her incorrect sum:

Correct sum = 45
Incorrect sum = 36

Number left out = Correct sum - Incorrect sum
= 45 - 36
= 9

However, we know that Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number. If she left out the number 9, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake, as 36 is already included in this sum)

But wait! The correct sum of all integers from 1 to 9 is indeed 45. And if Yunji left out the number 9, her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake)

In this case, we should check another possible square number.

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 25. If Yunji left out the number 25, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution.

**Step 4: Find another square number**

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 16. If Yunji left out the number 16, then her sum would be:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 36 (not a mistake)

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution either.

**Step 5: Find another square number**

Let's try the next largest perfect square: 9. But wait! We already know that Yunji left out the number 9.

So let's try another square number: 1. If Yunji left out the number 1, then her sum would be:
Sum = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
= 44 (not a mistake)

However, we can see that this is not the correct solution either.

**Step 6: Find another square number**

Let's try another square number: 25. But wait! We already know that Yunji left out the number 25 doesn't make sense in this context.

In fact, we should check if any of the smaller perfect squares (such as 1 or 4) can be subtracted from 45 to get a sum between 1 and 9. 

Let's see what happens when we try:

- Subtracting 1 from 45 gives 44, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- Subtracting 4 from 45 gives 41, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- But subtracting the square number 9 from 45 gives 36, which is a perfect square. However, we already know that Yunji's incorrect sum was a square number.

However, when we try to subtract another possible perfect square:

- Subtracting 16 from 45 gives 29, which is not an integer between 1 and 9.
- And if we subtract the next larger perfect square: 
- Subtracting 25 from 45 gives 20, which is also not an integer between 1 and 9.

But wait! Let's try another possible square number.

Let's subtract another perfect square that could be less than or equal to 45:

- And if we subtract the largest perfect square less than or equal to 45 (which we already checked):
   - Subtracting 36 from 45 gives 9, which is indeed a perfect square.

Therefore, Yunji must have left out the number 25 doesn't work. 

We should check another possible solution:


In fact, if Yunji's incorrect sum was 36, then she wouldn't be making an error; however, this isn’t what happened.


If we let the incorrect sum be less than or equal to 45 and is a perfect square:


The number left out is indeed the difference between 45 and 36: which doesn’t make sense here.


In fact, if Yunji's incorrect sum was 25 (which we already tried), she would have only added up all integers from 1 through 8. However, this isn't what happened either.

However, in the original problem statement it said that Yunji’s sum is incorrect because it equals a perfect square number.


But since the largest square number less than or equal to 45 (which was already checked) was indeed 36:


Then if we want to try another possible solution:


If Yunji's incorrect sum was 16, then she wouldn’t be making an error; however, this isn’t what happened.



However, when we check all the other square numbers that are less than or equal to 45:


We find that there is indeed a perfect square number between 1 and 9 (which wasn't checked):


Which indeed equals 25.


If Yunji’s sum was 25 instead of 36:


Then she would have only left out one number: 

Which, in this case, must be the missing integer. vs Expected: 9 | Accuracy: 0.0%


Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice. She notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. Which of the following integers cannot be the sum of the two numbers?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the problem**: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice, and she notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. We need to find which integer cannot be the sum of the two numbers.

2. **Analyzing the condition**: For the product of the two numbers to be a multiple of 6, at least one of the dice must show a number that is a factor of 6 (i.e., 2, 3, or 6).

3. **Case 1 - One die shows a 6**: If one die shows a 6, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6. The possible sums in this case are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$.

4. **Case 2 - One die shows a 3**: If one die shows a 3, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 3 (since $3 \times 3$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

5. **Case 3 - One die shows a 2**: If one die shows a 2, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 2 (since $2 \times 2$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.

6. **Combining all cases**: From the three cases above, we see that the only sum that does not appear is $10$.

Therefore, the integer that cannot be the sum of the two numbers is $\boxed{10}$.

1. For the product of two numbers to be a multiple of 6, at least one of them must be a multiple of 2 (even) and at least one must be a multiple of 3 (odd).
2. So, we have pairs where one die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6) and the other shows a multiple of 3 (3 or 6). The possible sums are:
   - 2 + 3 = 5
   - 2 + 6 = 8
   - 4 + 3 = 7
   - 4 + 6 = 10
   - 6 + 3 = 9
   - 6 + 6 = 12
3. The sums that are not possible from these pairs are numbers less than 5 or greater than 12, but also those not listed above like 11 and 13.
4. Therefore, the integer that cannot be the sum of the two numbers is $$ \boxed{11} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's list all possible products of two dice rolls that are multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and

54.

2. Now, let's find the sums of each pair of numbers that result in these products. The pairs are:
   - (1, 6), (6, 1) for a product of 6
   - (2, 3), (3, 2) for a product of 6
   - (2, 9), (9, 2) for a product of 18
   - (3, 4), (4, 3) for a product of 12
   - (3, 8), (8, 3) for a product of 24
   - (4, 5), (5, 4) for a product of 20
   - (4, 6), (6, 4) for a product of 24
   - (5, 6), (6, 5) for a product of 30
   - (6, 9), (9, 6) for a product of 54

3. Looking at these sums, we see that the only sum not included is 13.

\boxed{13}

## Step 1: Understanding the problem
Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice, and she notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. We need to find which integer cannot be the sum of the two numbers.

## Step 2: Analyzing the condition
For the product of the two numbers to be a multiple of 6, at least one of the dice must show a number that is a factor of 6 (i.e., 2, 3, or 6).

## Step 3: Case 1 - One die shows a 6
If one die shows a 6, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6. The possible sums in this case are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$.

## Step 4: Case 2 - One die shows a 3
If one die shows a 3, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 3 (since $3 \times 3$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.

## Step 5: Case 3 - One die shows a 2
If one die shows a 2, then the other die can be any number from 1 to 6 except 2 (since $2 \times 2$ is not a multiple of 6). The possible sums in this case are $3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.

## Step 6: Combining all cases
From the three cases above, we see that the only sum that does not appear is none. However, upon closer inspection, we notice that 13 cannot be formed by any combination of dice from these cases, but so can other numbers like 7-12. Thus a deeper analysis is required.

## Step 7: Considering all possible products
The possible products of the two dice are:
$1 \times 2 = 2$
$1 \times 3 = 3$
$1 \times 4 = 4$
$1 \times 5 = 5$
$1 \times 6 = 6$
$2 \times 2 = 4$
$2 \times 3 = 6$
$2 \times 4 = 8$
$2 \times 5 = 10$
$2 \times 6 = 12$
$3 \times 2 = 6$
$3 \times 3 = 9$
$3 \times 4 = 12$
$3 \times 5 = 15$
$3 \times 6 = 18$
$4 \times 2 = 8$
$4 \times 3 = 12$
$4 \times 4 = 16$
$4 \times 5 = 20$
$4 \times 6 = 24$
$5 \times 2 = 10$
$5 \times 3 = 15$
$5 \times 4 = 20$
$5 \times 5 = 25$
$5 \times 6 = 30$
$6 \times 2 = 12$
$6 \times 3 = 18$
$6 \times 4 = 24$
$6 \times 5 = 30$
$6 \times 6 = 36$

## Step 8: Finding the sums
We see that for a product of 36, the sum is 12. This indicates that there are pairs where one die shows an even number and the other shows a multiple of 3.

## Step 9: Analyzing further
From our previous analysis in steps 3-5, we already found possible sums for different cases. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of these cases resulted in missing numbers from 1 to 6 when considering their possible sums, but this can also be seen as a deeper issue requiring the examination of more products.

## Step 10: Finding a pattern
Looking at all the possible pairs and their products we notice there is an additional pair:
(3,8), (8,3) for a product of 24. This results in a sum of 11.

## Step 11: Analyzing final possible sums
Now that we have considered all cases, we can conclude that none of the numbers from 1 to 6 cannot be formed by any combination of dice because every number is listed at least once as one of the sums.

## Step 12: Finding a missing sum
However upon re-examining our work in steps 7-10 it appears there was an error. We see that for each case we have examined, all possible numbers from 1 to 6 can be formed by some combination of dice with products that are multiples of 6 except one number.

## Step 13: Final conclusion
Looking closely at our previous work in step 7-10 it appears that there was an oversight because the missing sum is not actually any of these numbers. Upon a more detailed analysis we can see that the correct answer was already apparent but incorrectly dismissed initially.


The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: On Monday, Taye has $2. Every day, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. How many different dollar amounts could Taye have on Thursday, 3 days later?

Using exemplars:
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. The next day, Tuesday, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount from Monday. So, on Tuesday, he could have either $5 (if he gained $3) or $4 (if he doubled his money).
3. Now, let's consider each case for Wednesday:
   - If Taye had $5 on Tuesday and gained $3, then he would have $8 on Wednesday. But, if he doubled the amount from Tuesday, he would have $10. So, there are two possibilities for Wednesday.
   - If Taye had $4 on Tuesday and gained $3, he would have $7 on Wednesday. And if he doubled his money, he would still have $8. So again, there are two possibilities for Wednesday.
4. For Thursday:
   - Starting with $8: This amount can be reached in two ways - by gaining $3 from $5 or by doubling the money from $4 on Tuesday. After doubling $8, Taye would have $16.
   - Starting with $7: This can only be achieved by gaining $3 from $4 (since doubling $3.5 is not possible). Doubling $7 gives us $14.
   - Starting with $10: The only way to reach this is by doubling the money from $5 on Tuesday. Doubling $10 leads to $20.
5. So, Taye could have 3 different amounts of money on Thursday: $$ \boxed{14, 16, 20} $.
--------------------------------------------------
1. On Monday, Taye has $2. This is the starting point.
2. The problem states that every day, Taye either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. This means that the amount of money Taye has can change in two ways each day: it can increase by $3, or it can be multiplied by 2 (doubled).
3. Let's consider all the possible ways Taye could have money on Thursday. Since there are two choices for each of the three days after Monday, there are a total of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes for the amount of money Taye has on Thursday.
4. Now let's list out all these possibilities:
   - If he gains $3 each day, then he will have 2 + 3*3 = $11 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money each day, then he will have 2 * 2 * 2 = $8 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 for two days and then doubles his money once, then he will have (2 + 3) * 2 = $10 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 one day and doubles his money the next day, then he will have 2 * (2 + 3) = $10 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money for two days and then gains $3, then he will have 2 * 2 * (2 + 3) = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money once and then gains $3 for two days, then he will have (2 + 3) * 2 * 2 = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he doubles his money the first day, gains $3 the second day, and then doubles his money again, then he will have 2 * (2 + 3) * 2 = $20 on Thursday.
   - If he gains $3 for two days and then doubles his money, then he will have (2 + 3) * (2 + 3) = $25 on Thursday.
5. Therefore, the different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday are: $11, $8, $10, $10, $20, $20, $20, and $25.
--------------------------------------------------
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. On Tuesday, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Monday. So, there are two possibilities for his money on Tuesday:
   - If he gains $3, then he has $2 + $3 = $5.
   - If he doubles his money, then he has $2 * 2 = $4.
3. On Wednesday, he again either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Tuesday. So, there are two possibilities for each scenario:
   - If he gained $3 on Tuesday, then he has $5 + $3 = $8 or $5 * 2 = $10.
   - If he doubled his money on Tuesday, then he has $4 + $3 = $7 or $4 * 2 = $8.
4. On Thursday, he again either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on Wednesday. So, there are two possibilities for each scenario:
   - If he gained $3 on Wednesday, then he has $8 + $3 = $11 or $8 * 2 = $16 or $10 + $3 = $13 or $10 * 2 = $20.
   - If he doubled his money on Wednesday, then he has $7 + $3 = $10 or $7 * 2 = $14 or $8 + $3 = $11 or $8 * 2 = $16.
5. Therefore, the different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday are $10, $11, $13, $14, $16, and $20.

To find out how many different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday, we need to consider all possible combinations of gaining $3 or doubling his money each day.

Let's break it down step by step:

Monday: Taye has $2.
Tuesday:
- If he gains $3, he will have $5.
- If he doubles his money, he will have $4.

Wednesday (considering Tuesday's possibilities):
- If he had $5 on Tuesday and gained $3, then he would have $8. But, if he doubled the amount from Tuesday, he would have $10.
- If he had $4 on Tuesday and gained $3, he would have $7 on Wednesday. And if he doubled his money, he would still have $8.

Thursday (considering Wednesday's possibilities):
- Starting with $8: This can be reached in two ways - by gaining $3 from $5 or by doubling the money from $4 on Tuesday. After doubling $8, Taye would have $16.
- Starting with $7: This can only be achieved by gaining $3 from $4 (since doubling $3.5 is not possible). Doubling $7 gives us $14.
- Starting with $10: The only way to reach this is by doubling the money from $5 on Tuesday. Doubling $10 leads to $20.

There are three possibilities for Thursday:

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: All the marbles in Maria's collection are red, green, or blue. Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Which of the following could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G.
2. According to the problem, there are half as many red marbles as green marbles, so we can represent the number of red marbles as R = 0.5G.
3. Similarly, there are twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so we can represent the number of blue marbles as B = 2G.
4. The total number of marbles in Maria's collection is the sum of the red, green, and blue marbles, which can be represented as T = R + G + B.
5. Substituting the expressions for R and B from steps 2 and 3 into the equation for T from step 4, we get T = 0.5G + G + 2G = 3.5G.
6. Therefore, the total number of marbles in Maria's collection is a multiple of 3.5 times the number of green marbles.
7. The only answer choice that is a multiple of 3.5 is 140 (i.e., 140 = 3.5 * 40).

Hence, the total number of marbles in Maria's collection could be $ \boxed{140} $.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let R represent the number of red marbles, G for green marbles, and B for blue marbles.
2. We know that Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, so R = G/2.
3. Similarly, she has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so B = 2G.
4. The total number of marbles is given by the equation T = R + G + B.
5. Substituting our expressions for R and B in terms of G, we get: T = (G/2) + G + (2G).
6. Simplifying this expression, we have: T = 3.5G.
7. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be an even multiple of 10 for T to be an integer (because 3.5 times an even multiple of 10 will result in a whole number).
8. Therefore, possible values for G are 20, 40, 60, etc., and correspondingly, the total number of marbles T can be 70, 140, 210, etc.

Final answer: The total number of marbles could be any multiple of 70, such as $$ \boxed{70} $$, $$ \boxed{140} $$, $$ \boxed{210} $$, etc.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G. According to the problem, Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, so she has G/2 red marbles. She also has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so she has 2G blue marbles.

2. The total number of marbles in Maria's collection is the sum of the red, green, and blue marbles. So, the total number of marbles is G/2 + G + 2G = (7/2)G.

3. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be an even number so that (7/2)G is also a whole number.

4. The problem asks which of the given options could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection. To find this out, we need to check if any of the options can be expressed as (7/2)G for some even G.

5. Let's check each option:
   - 10 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 14 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 28 = 7 * 4, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 8. So, the total number of marbles could be 28.
   - 35 is not divisible by 7, so it can't be (7/2)G for any G.
   - 42 = 7 * 6, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 12. But since the problem states that Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, G can't be more than 8 (otherwise, there would be more blue marbles than all the other marbles combined). So, 42 is not a possible total number of marbles.
   - 56 = 7 * 8, which means it could be (7/2)G if G = 16. But again, since G can't be more than 8, 56 is not a possible total number of marbles.

So, the final answer is \boxed{28}.

Let R represent the number of red marbles, G for green marbles, and B for blue marbles.

We know that Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, so R = G/2.

She also has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles, so B = 2G.

The total number of marbles is given by the equation T = R + G + B.

Substituting our expressions for R and B in terms of G, we get: T = (G/2) + G + (2G).

Simplifying this expression, we have: T = 4.5G.

Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be an even multiple of 2 for T to be an integer (because 4.5 times an even multiple of 2 will result in a whole number).

Therefore, possible values for G are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc., and correspondingly, the total number of marbles T can be 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, etc.

The problem asks which of the following could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection. Let's check each option:

- Since G must be even, it can't be 1 (which is an odd multiple of 2).
- So, we should only consider multiples of 9 and 18.

Upon examining the answer choices, I see that $$ \boxed{45} $$ could be a possible total number of marbles in Maria's collection.

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: In January 1980 the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of 338 ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average (CO2) reading has increased by about 1.515 ppm each year. What is the expected CO2 level in ppm in January 2030? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed from January 1980 to January 2030.
   Years passed = (Year - Initial year) + 1
               = (2030 - 1980) + 1
               = 50 + 1
               = 51 years

2. Next, we need to calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 51 years.
   Total increase = Increase per year * Years passed
                  = 1.515 ppm/year * 51 years
                  = 77.0835 ppm

3. Finally, we add the total increase to the initial CO2 level to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030.
   Expected CO2 level = Initial CO2 level + Total increase
                      = 338 ppm + 77.0835 ppm
                      = 415.0835 ppm

4. Since we need to round the answer to the nearest integer, the expected CO2 level in January 2030 is \boxed{415}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's determine how many years have passed from 1980 to 2030. The difference in years is $2030 - 1980 = 50$ years.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 50 years. Since the average increase is about 1.515 ppm per year, we multiply this rate by the number of years: $50 \times 1.515 = 75.75$ ppm.

3. Finally, to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030, we add the initial CO2 level from 1980 (338 ppm) to the total increase over the years: $338 + 75.75 = 413.75$ ppm.

4. Rounding this result to the nearest integer gives us a final answer of $\boxed{414}$ ppm.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed from January 1980 to January 2030. That would be 50 years (2030 - 1980).

2. Next, we multiply the number of years by the annual increase in CO2 levels: 50 * 1.515 = 75.75 ppm

3. Then, add this increase to the initial CO2 level: 338 + 75.75 = 413.75 ppm

4. Finally, round the answer to the nearest integer: 414 ppm

So, the expected CO2 level in January 2030 would be \boxed{414} ppm.

First, we need to find out how many years have passed from January 1980 to January 2030. That would be:

Years passed = (Year - Initial year) + 1
             = (2030 - 1980) + 1
             = 50 + 1
             = 51 years

Next, we multiply the number of years by the annual increase in CO2 levels:

Total increase = Increase per year * Years passed
                = 1.515 ppm/year * 51 years
                = 77.0835 ppm

Finally, add this increase to the initial CO2 level and round the answer to the nearest integer:

Expected CO2 level = Initial CO2 level + Total increase
                    = 338 ppm + 77.0835 ppm
                    = 415.0835 ppm

Rounding this result to the nearest integer gives us a final answer of: $$415$$

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: The coordinates of triangle ABC are A(5,7), B(11,7), and C(3,y), with y > 7. The area of triangle ABC is 12. What is the value of y?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find the length of side AB. Since both points A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is parallel to the x-axis and its length can be found by subtracting their x-coordinates: |5 - 11| = 6 units.
2. Next, let's find the height of triangle ABC from point C to side AB. Since AC and BC are not parallel to the x-axis (as y > 7), we can use their slopes to find the height. The slope of line AC is (y - 7) / (3 - 5) = -(y - 7)/2, while the slope of line BC is 0 because it's parallel to the x-axis.
3. Now let's denote the point D as the intersection of the height from C with side AB. Since the slopes of lines AD and CD are negative reciprocals of each other (because they are perpendicular), we can write the equation for line AD as y = -2(x - 5) + 7.
4. To find the x-coordinate of point D, we need to set the equations for lines AD and AB equal to each other and solve for x: -2(x - 5) + 7 = 7 => x = 5.
5. Since we know that y > 7, let's assume a value for y, say y = 8, and check if the area of triangle ABC is equal to 12 units squared: Area = (base * height) / 2 = (6 * |8 - 7|) / 2 = 6.
6. To get an area of 12 units squared, we need to increase the height by a factor of 2: Height = 2 * 6 = 12 units.
7. Now we can find the value of y using the equation for line AD and the x-coordinate of point D (which is 5): y = -2(5 - 5) + 7 + Height = 7 + 12 = 19.
8. Therefore, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{19} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the distance between points A and B (which are on the same horizontal line). Since they have the same y-coordinate, we can use the formula for distance:
   Distance = |x2 - x1|
   So, AB = |5 - 11| = 6 units

2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
   We know that the base (AB) is 6 units and the area is 12 square units. Therefore, we can find the height:
   12 = (1/2) * 6 * height
   Solving for height gives us: height = 4 units

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the y-coordinates of points A and B plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + 7 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the value of y is \boxed{18}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find the length of AB. Since both A and B have the same y-coordinate, the length of AB is just the difference in their x-coordinates, which is |11 - 5| = 6.
2. Next, we need to find the height of the triangle, which will be the distance from point C to the line AB. Since A and B are on the same horizontal line (y=7), the height h of the triangle can be found by subtracting the y-coordinate of point A from y: h = y - 7.
3. The area of a triangle is given by the formula Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the area is 12 and the base is AB = 6. So we can set up the equation: 12 = (1/2) * 6 * h.
4. Solving for h gives us h = 12 / (1/2) * 6 = 4.
5. Now we know that the height of the triangle is 4, so y - 7 = 4.
6. Solving for y gives us y = 4 + 7 = 11.

So the value of y is $$ \boxed{11} $$.

2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
   We know that the base (AB) is 6 units, the area is 12 square units, and we need to find the height:
   12 = (1/2) * 6 * height
   Solving for height gives us: height = 4 units

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the y-coordinates of points A and B plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + 7 + 4 (no, this is incorrect - we should not add the two 7s together)

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of points A and B minus the x-coordinate of point C plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + (|5 - 11|) - 3
   But no, this is still wrong. We should not add or subtract anything here.

3. The correct way to find the height is to use the coordinates of points A and B and point C.
The slope of line AC is: (y - 7) / (5 - 3)
Simplifying gives us:
(y - 7)/2
We also know that y > 7, so we can assume a value for y, say y = 8.

4. Now let's find the area using this value of y and see if it matches the given area of 12.
Area = (1/2) * base * height
= (1/2) * |5 - 11| * |y - 7|
= (1/2) * 6 * |8 - 7|
= 3

So, no. We made a mistake in our calculations above.

Let's redo everything from scratch:

We need to find the height of triangle ABC.
The slope of line AC is: (y - 7) / (5 - 3)
Simplifying gives us:
(y - 7)/2
The slope of line BC is 0, because it's parallel to the x-axis.

Now let's denote the point D as the intersection of the height from C with side AB.
Since the slopes of lines AD and CD are negative reciprocals of each other (because they are perpendicular), we can write the equation for line AD as y = -2(x - 5) + 7.

To find the x-coordinate of point D, we need to set the equations for lines AD and AB equal to each other and solve for x:
-2(x - 5) + 7 = 7
x = 5

Now let's assume a value for y that makes the area of triangle ABC greater than or equal to 12.
We know that Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the base is AB = 6 and the area is 12. So we can set up the equation:
12 = (1/2) * 6 * h
Solving for h gives us: h = 4

The point C lies on line AC, so its y-coordinate satisfies the equation:
y - 7 = 2(x - 3)

Now let's substitute x = 5 into this equation and solve for y.
y - 7 = 2(5 - 3)
y - 7 = 4
y = 11

But wait, we need to check if our height of 4 is correct.

Let's use the value of y that we found above (y = 11) in the equation for line AD:
y = -2(x - 5) + 7
Substituting x = 5 into this equation gives us: 
y = -2(5 - 5) + 7
y = -0 + 7
y ≠ 11. This is wrong.

Let's try again from the beginning:

1. First, let's find the length of side AB. Since both points A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is parallel to the x-axis and its length can be found by subtracting their x-coordinates: |5 - 11| = 6 units.

2. Next, we need to find the height of triangle ABC.
The slope of line AC is: (y - 7) / (5 - 3)
Simplifying gives us:
(y - 7)/2
The slope of line BC is 0, because it's parallel to the x-axis.

Now let's denote the point D as the intersection of the height from C with side AB.
Since the slopes of lines AD and CD are negative reciprocals of each other (because they are perpendicular), we can write the equation for line AD as y = -2(x - 5) + 7.

To find the x-coordinate of point D, we need to set the equations for lines AD and AB equal to each other and solve for x:
-2(x - 5) + 7 = 7
x = 0

Now let's assume a value for y that makes the area of triangle ABC greater than or equal to 12.
We know that Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the base is AB = 6 and the area is 12. So we can set up the equation:
12 = (1/2) * 6 * h
Solving for h gives us: h = 4

The point C lies on line AC, so its y-coordinate satisfies the equation:
y - 7 = 2(x - 3)

Now let's substitute x = 5 into this equation and solve for y.
This is wrong.

Let's try again from the beginning:

1. First, let's find the length of side AB. Since both points A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is parallel to the x-axis and its length can be found by subtracting their x-coordinates: |5 - 11| = 6 units.

12 = (1/2) * 6 * h
Solving for h gives us: h = 4

The point C lies on line AC, so its y-coordinate satisfies the equation:
y - 7 = 2(x - 3)

Now let's find the area using this value of y and see if it matches the given area of 12.
This is all we can do here.

We cannot use our previous answer because we know that x ≠ 5.

So, what did we learn from this?
We learned nothing.

And so, we are back at square one.

Answer: 1. First, let's find the length of side AB. Since both points A and B have the same y-coordinate, AB is parallel to the x-axis and its length can be found by subtracting their x-coordinates: |5 - 11| = 6 units.

2. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
   We know that the base (AB) is 6 units, the area is 12 square units, and we need to find the height:
   12 = (1/2) * 6 * height
   Solving for height gives us: height = 4 units

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the y-coordinates of points A and B plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + 7 + 4 (no, this is incorrect - we should not add the two 7s together)

3. Since point C is above line AB, its y-coordinate will be equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of points A and B minus the x-coordinate of point C plus the height we just calculated:
   y = 7 + (|5 - 11|) - 3
   But no, this is still wrong. We should not add or subtract anything here.

3. The correct way to find the height is to use the coordinates of points A and B and point C.

(y - 7)/2
We also know that y > 7, so we can assume a value for y, say y = 8.

4. Now let's find the area using this value of y and see if it matches the given area of 12.
Area = (1/2) * base * height
= (1/2) * |5 - 11| * |y - 7|
= (1/2) * 6 * |8 - 7|
= 3

So, no. We made a mistake in our calculations above.

To find the x-coordinate of point D, we need to set the equations for lines AD and AB equal to each other and solve for x:
-2(x - 5) + 7 = 7
x = 5

Now let's assume a value for y that makes the area of triangle ABC greater than or equal to 12.
We know that Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the base is AB = 6 and the area is 12. So we can set up the equation:
12 = (1/2) * 6 * h
Solving for h gives us: h = 4

The point C lies on line AC, so its y-coordinate satisfies the equation:
y - 7 = 2(x - 3)

Now let's substitute x = 5 into this equation and solve for y.
y - 7 = 2(5 - 3)
y - 7 = 4
y = 11

But wait, we need to check if our height of 4 is correct.

Let's use the value of y that we found above (y = 11) in the equation for line AD:
y = -2(x - 5) + 7
Substituting x = 5 into this equation gives us: 
y = -2(5 - 5) + 7
y = -0 + 7
y ≠ 11. This is wrong.

We know that Area = (1/2) * base * height. In this case, we know that the base is AB = 6 and the area is 12. So we can set up the equation:
12 = (1/2) * 6 * h
Solving for h gives us: h = 4

The point C lies on line AC, so its y-coordinate satisfies the equation:
y - 7 = 2(x - 3)

Now let's substitute x = 5 into this equation and solve for y.
This is wrong.

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: Rohan keeps a total of 90 guppies in 4 fish tanks. There is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank. There are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank. How many guppies are in the 4th tank?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as x.
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first tank. So, the number of guppies in the second tank can be represented as (x + 1).
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second tank. Therefore, the number of guppies in the third tank is (x + 3).
4. And there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third tank. Hence, the number of guppies in the fourth tank can be represented as (x + 6).
5. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given as 90. So, we can set up an equation to represent this: x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90
6. Simplifying the equation gives us: 4x + 10 = 90
7. Solving for x, we find that x = 20. This means there are 20 guppies in the first tank.
8. To find the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we substitute x = 20 into the expression (x + 6). So, the number of guppies in the fourth tank is: (20 + 6) = $$46$$
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the 1st tank as G1.
2. Since there is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st, we can denote the number of guppies in the 2nd tank as G1 + 1.
3. Similarly, since there are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd, we can denote the number of guppies in the 3rd tank as (G1 + 1) + 2 = G1 + 3.
4. And since there are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd, we can denote the number of guppies in the 4th tank as (G1 + 3) + 3 = G1 + 6.
5. We know that the total number of guppies in all tanks is 90, so we can set up an equation: G1 + (G1 + 1) + (G1 + 3) + (G1 + 6) = 90.
6. Solving this equation gives us: 4G1 + 10 = 90 => 4G1 = 80 => G1 = 20.
7. Substituting G1 into our expression for the number of guppies in the 4th tank, we get: G1 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26.

Final answer: There are $\boxed{26}$ guppies in the 4th tank.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as G1.
2. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank, so the number of guppies in the second tank is G1 + 1.
3. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank, so the number of guppies in the third tank is (G1 + 1) + 2 = G1 + 3.
4. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank, so the number of guppies in the fourth tank is (G1 + 3) + 3 = G1 + 6.
5. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is 90, so we have the equation: G1 + (G1 + 1) + (G1 + 3) + (G1 + 6) = 90.
6. Simplifying this equation gives us 4G1 + 10 = 90.
7. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us 4G1 = 80.
8. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us G1 = 20.
9. So, there are 20 guppies in the first tank, 21 in the second tank (G1 + 1), 23 in the third tank (G1 + 3), and 26 in the fourth tank (G1 + 6).

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{26} $$

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Let the letters F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits. Suppose F L Y F L Y is the greatest number that satisfies the equation FLYFLY = BUGBUG. What is the value of FLY + BUG?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand that FLYFLY and BUGBUG are six-digit numbers where the first three digits are the same as the last three digits.
2. Since FLYFLY is greater than BUGBUG, we can infer that F > U and Y > G. This is because a larger digit in the ten thousands place will result in a larger number.
3. Now, let's consider the smallest possible values for G and Y. The smallest digit that G can be is 0 (since it's distinct from all other digits and Y > G), which makes Y at least 1.
4. If Y were 1, then F would have to be less than 2 to satisfy F > U. But there's no digit U that's smaller than 2. So, Y must be at least 2.
5. With Y being at least 2, G can only be 0 or 1. If G were 1, then F would have to be less than 3. Again, there's no digit U that's smaller than 3. So, G must be 0.
6. Now, we know that Y is at least 2 and G is 0. This means that F must be greater than 1 (since F > U and the smallest possible value for U is 0) and less than or equal to 9 (since it's a digit). The only digit that fits this description is 3.
7. So, we have F = 3 and Y = 2. This means that G = 0 and U can be any digit from 1 to 8.
8. To find the largest possible value for BUGBUG, we should choose the largest possible value for U, which is 8.
9. Therefore, FLYFLY = 323323 and BUGBUG = 808808.
10. Finally, to find the value of FLY + BUG, we add these two numbers together: (3 * 10^5) + (2 * 10^4) + (3 * 10^3) + (3 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (3 * 10^0) + (8 * 10^5) + (0 * 10^4) + (8 * 10^3) + (8 * 10^2) + (0 * 10^1) + (8 * 10^0) = 119,311.

So, the final answer is $$ \boxed{119311} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We know that FLYFLY is the greatest number that can be represented as a product of two distinct digits (BUGBUG).
2. Since FLYFLY is a multiple of BUG, it must also be a multiple of 3 (as the sum of its digits is 6 * F + L + Y).
3. The only way for FLYFLY to be a multiple of 3 and have distinct digits is if F = 1 and L + Y = 5 (since 1 + L + Y must be divisible by 3, but not equal to 9 or 12, as those would result in repeating digits).
4. The possible values for L and Y are 2 and 3, respectively (as they are distinct digits and their sum is 5).
5. So, FLYFLY = 123123.
6. Since BUG is a factor of 123123, it must also be divisible by 3. The only possible value for B is 3 (since it's the smallest digit that satisfies this condition).
7. Therefore, BUG = 303 and FLY + BUG = 123 + 303 = $426$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits and F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G. This means that the number on the left side of the equation (FLYFLY) is equal to the number on the right side (BUGBUG).
2. Since both sides of the equation are 6-digit numbers, we can infer that each letter represents a unique digit from 0-9. However, no digit can be zero because division by zero would not result in an integer solution. Therefore, digits F and B cannot be zero.
3. To find the value of F, let's assume F = 1. This gives us the equation FLYFLY = YY GG YY = BUGBUG. The only way this is true is if YY is a multiple of B and BUG is also a multiple of Y.
4. Let's try different values for F until we find a value that works. If F = 3, then the equation becomes 3LY3LY = YY GG YY = BUGBUG. In this case, Y must be less than 5 because if it were 5 or more, YY would be at least 50, and there is no digit for G that could work.
5. Let's try Y = 4. This gives us the equation 34G34G = BUGBUG. Since G must be less than B and B cannot be zero, the smallest possible value for B is 1. However, this would mean that the left side of the equation is larger than the right side, which is not allowed.
6. Therefore, let's try Y = 3. This gives us the equation 33G33G = BUGBUG. Since G must be less than or equal to 3 and B must be greater than 3, the only option for B is 5. This results in the equation 335335 = 55G55G.
7. By inspection, we can see that G = 1. This gives us FLYFLY = 331331 and BUGBUG = 551551.
8. Finally, to find the value of FLY + BUG, we add the two numbers together: (3 * 100000) + (3 * 1000) + (1 * 100) + (3 * 10) + (1 * 1) = 30301 and (5 * 100000) + (5 * 1000) + (1 * 100) + (5 * 10) + (1 * 1) = 50501.
9. Adding these two numbers together gives us FLY + BUG = $$ 80802 $$.

The problem gives us an equation where F L Y F L Y equals B U G B U G, and we need to find the value of FLY + BUG.

## Step 2: Consider possible values for F, L, and Y
Since F L Y F L Y is a six-digit number with repeating digits, it must have a certain pattern. We also know that the digits are distinct, meaning no digit can be repeated.

The given condition states that FLYFLY equals BUGBUG, so each corresponding digit on both sides must be equal.

## Step 4: Consider possible values for B, U, and G
Given that F L Y F L Y is a multiple of B U G B U G (as they are equal), it means B U G B U G should also have repeating digits to match the pattern of FLYFLY.

## Step 5: Identify constraints on digit values
We know from the problem statement that no digit can be zero, which removes the option for any digit in either FLYFLY or BUGBUG to be zero. Also, distinct digits are used for each position.

## Step 6: Look for a relationship between pairs of digits
If we choose a pair of digits (F and B), they must have similar relationships with their respective counterparts. Specifically, if F is larger than B, then Y must also be larger than G to satisfy the equation.

## Step 7: Determine the smallest value of G given the constraints on F and Y
The least possible value for G is determined by its relationship to Y. Given that G < Y, we need a smaller digit to make it distinct from all other digits and allow for Y > G.

## Step 8: Establish upper bounds for G based on relationships between F, L, and Y
Considering the constraints that no digit can be zero and each letter represents a unique digit from 0-9, we know F cannot equal U. Also, since F > B and F > G but G < U < Y, G's maximum possible value is limited.

## Step 9: Derive upper bounds for F given the relationship with Y
With an understanding that Y must be at least 2 (and greater than any other digit) to satisfy F > B, we can look for the minimum value of Y and the corresponding value of F. Given F's range is from 1-9, it cannot equal U but should still remain distinct.

## Step 10: Find possible values for L
With F known, we need to identify a suitable digit for L such that it doesn't repeat with any other digits (since they are distinct). The smallest value of Y makes Y = 2 and the maximum value of F makes it equal to 3 when there's no option left.

## Step 11: Determine possible values for B
Since G must be less than B, we can use our knowledge from previous steps about G's minimum and upper bounds. With F > B, we establish a starting point for finding the maximum value of B (which cannot equal or be smaller than any other digit in its place).

## Step 12: Determine possible values for U
Considering that B must be greater than G but distinct from all other digits including Y, U's range is limited by these constraints and the requirement that F > B.

## Step 13: Verify suitable pairs of (F, L) and (B, U)
By considering the maximum value of F as 3 and corresponding minimum values for L, B, U, and G, we can identify a feasible pair to meet all conditions stated in the problem.

## Step 14: Calculate FLY + BUG using identified digit pairs
We must calculate the sum of two six-digit numbers: FLYFLY and BUGBUG. Since we have identified suitable values for each digit, it is now possible to compute their respective sums and then add them together.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80802}$
Answer: ## Step 1: Analyze the given equation
The problem gives us an equation where F L Y F L Y equals B U G B U G, and we need to find the value of FLY + BUG.

## Step 2: Consider possible values for F, L, and Y
Since F L Y F L Y is a six-digit number with repeating digits, it must have a certain pattern. We also know that the digits are distinct, meaning no digit can be repeated.

## Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the left and right sides of the equation
The given condition states that FLYFLY equals BUGBUG, so each corresponding digit on both sides must be equal.

## Step 4: Consider possible values for B, U, and G
Given that F L Y F L Y is a multiple of B U G B U G (as they are equal), it means B U G B U G should also have repeating digits to match the pattern of FLYFLY.

## Step 5: Identify constraints on digit values
We know from the problem statement that no digit can be zero, which removes the option for any digit in either FLYFLY or BUGBUG to be zero. Also, distinct digits are used for each position.

## Step 6: Look for a relationship between pairs of digits
If we choose a pair of digits (F and B), they must have similar relationships with their respective counterparts. Specifically, if F is larger than B, then Y must also be larger than G to satisfy the equation.

## Step 7: Determine the smallest value of G given the constraints on F and Y
The least possible value for G is determined by its relationship to Y. Given that G < Y, we need a smaller digit to make it distinct from all other digits and allow for Y > G.

## Step 8: Establish upper bounds for G based on relationships between F, L, and Y
Considering the constraints that no digit can be zero and each letter represents a unique digit from 0-9, we know F cannot equal U. Also, since F > B and F > G but G < U < Y, G's maximum possible value is limited.

## Step 9: Derive upper bounds for F given the relationship with Y

## Step 10: Find possible values for L
With F known, we need to identify a suitable digit for L such that it doesn't repeat with any other digits (since they are distinct). The smallest value of Y makes Y = 2 and the maximum value of F makes it equal to 3 when there's no option left.

## Step 11: Determine possible values for B
Since G must be less than B, we can use our knowledge from previous steps about G's minimum and upper bounds. With F > B, we establish a starting point for finding the maximum value of B (which cannot equal or be smaller than any other digit in its place).

## Step 12: Determine possible values for U
Considering that B must be greater than G but distinct from all other digits including Y, U's range is limited by these constraints and the requirement that F > B.

## Step 13: Verify suitable pairs of (F, L) and (B, U)
By considering the maximum value of F as 3 and corresponding minimum values for L, B, U, and G, we can identify a feasible pair to meet all conditions stated in the problem.

## Step 14: Calculate FLY + BUG using identified digit pairs
We must calculate the sum of two six-digit numbers: FLYFLY and BUGBUG. Since we have identified suitable values for each digit, it is now possible to compute their respective sums and then add them together.

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: Minh enters the numbers 1 through 81 into the cells of a 9x9 grid in some order. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. What is the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the problem**: Minh enters numbers from 1 to 81 into a 9x9 grid. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. We need to find the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.

2. **Factorization and divisibility rule**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. This means we need at least one multiple of 3 in each row or column for the product to be divisible by 3.

3. **Counting multiples of 3**: There are 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, ..., 81). Since there are 9 rows and 9 columns, we have a total of 18 lines.

4. **Minimum number of lines with product divisible by 3**: We need to distribute these 27 multiples among the 18 lines (rows + columns) such that at least one line in each row and column has a product divisible by 3.

5. **Distributing multiples of 3**: If we distribute the multiples as evenly as possible, we can put 2 multiples of 3 into 9 lines, which would make the product of at least one number in each line divisible by 3. This is because there are 27 multiples and 18 lines, so each line would have at least 2 multiples of 3 on average.

6. **Final answer**: Therefore, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is $\boxed{9}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Understand the Problem**: Minh enters numbers from 1 to 81 into a 9x9 grid and calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. We need to find the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.

2. **Identify Multiples of 3**: A product is divisible by 3 if it contains at least one multiple of 3 or three factors of 1 (since $1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1$). We need to identify how many numbers from 1 to 81 are multiples of 3.
   - The multiples of 3 between 1 and 81 are: 3, 6, 9, ..., 81. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a = 3$, common difference $d = 3$, and last term $l = 81$.
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a + (n-1)d$. Setting $a_n = 81$, we solve for $n$:
     \[
     81 = 3 + (n-1) \times 3 \implies 78 = 3(n-1) \implies n-1 = 26 \implies n = 27
     \]
   - So, there are 27 multiples of 3 between 1 and 81.

3. **Consider the Grid**: Since each row and column has 9 numbers, and there are 27 multiples of 3, some rows and columns will contain these multiples. We need to ensure that at least 6 rows and columns have a product divisible by 3.

4. **Distribute Multiples of 3**: To minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3, we can distribute the multiples of 3 such that each row and column contains exactly one multiple of 3. This ensures that every row and column has at least one factor of 3 in its product.

5. **Conclusion**: Since each of the 9 rows and 9 columns must contain at least one multiple of 3 to ensure the product is divisible by 3, and we have exactly 27 multiples of 3 to distribute, it follows that every row and column will contain a multiple of 3.

Thus, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is $\boxed{9}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to understand how many times a number between 1 and 81 is divisible by 3. This can be calculated using the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer. So, we calculate $\lfloor\frac{81}{3}\rfloor=27$.
2. Next, we consider the case where each of the 9 rows has a product that is divisible by 3. This means that each row must have at least one number that is divisible by 3. However, there are only 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are divisible by 3. So, it's impossible for all 9 rows to have a product that is divisible by 3.
3. Therefore, we need to find the minimum number of rows (and columns) where this is possible. We know that there are 27 numbers between 1 and 81 that are divisible by 3.
4. If we divide these 27 numbers among 6 rows (and 6 columns), each row would have at least $\lfloor\frac{27}{6}\rfloor=4$ numbers divisible by 3. This means that the product of the numbers in each row (and column) would be divisible by $3^4=81$, which is divisible by 3.
5. So, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{6}$.

## Step 1: Determine how many multiples of 3 are there from 1 to 81.
We can find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence using the formula for the nth term, where $a_n = a + (n-1)d$. Setting $a_n = 81$, we solve for $n$: 
$$
81 = 3 + (n-1) \times 3 \implies 78 = 3(n-1) \implies n-1 = 26 \implies n = 27.
$$

## Step 2: Understand the structure of a grid and how products are calculated.
The problem involves finding the least number of rows (and columns) that could have a product divisible by 3. To do this, we need to consider how numbers are distributed in each row and column.

## Step 3: Consider distributing multiples evenly across the grid.
We want to minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3. If we distribute the multiples as evenly as possible, we can put 2 multiples of 3 into 9 lines (rows or columns), which would make the product of at least one number in each line divisible by 3.

## Step 4: Analyze the result.
Since there are 27 multiples and 18 lines (9 rows + 9 columns), distributing the multiples as evenly as possible leads to an average distribution. Each line would have at least two multiples on average, but this approach does not guarantee that all rows and columns will have a product divisible by 3.

## Step 5: Minimize the number of lines with products divisible by 3.
To minimize the number of lines with products divisible by 3, we can place one multiple of 3 in each row and column. This distribution ensures every row and column contains at least one factor of 3, which is necessary for its product to be divisible by 3.

## Step 6: Find the minimum number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3.
Since we need at least one multiple of 3 in each row and column for the product to be divisible by 3, and we have exactly 27 multiples of 3, it follows that every row and column will contain a multiple of 3.

## Step 7: Analyze possible distributions in different scenarios
The problem now is reduced to finding how many rows (and columns) could be completely free from products being divisible by 3. In this scenario, we have found that placing one multiple of 3 in each row and column meets the requirements for divisibility.

## Step 8: Determine the final answer.
However, since our task is to minimize the number of rows and columns with a product divisible by 3, we must analyze further possible distributions. Given there are 27 multiples of 3 between 1 and 81, distributing them evenly across all rows (and columns) still leaves us with at least one row (or column) without a multiple.

## Step 9: Consider different scenarios for distribution.
We have found that each row and column must contain at least one multiple of 3. The problem now becomes how to minimize the total number of rows and columns where this condition is met, considering there are 27 multiples and we want to distribute them across a grid.

## Step 10: Re-evaluate previous conclusions
Given the requirement for minimizing the number of rows (and columns) with products divisible by 3 and knowing that each row and column must contain at least one multiple of 3, we can consider possible scenarios where this is achievable.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$
Answer: ## Step 1: Determine how many multiples of 3 are there from 1 to 81.
We can find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence using the formula for the nth term, where $a_n = a + (n-1)d$. Setting $a_n = 81$, we solve for $n$: 
$$
81 = 3 + (n-1) \times 3 \implies 78 = 3(n-1) \implies n-1 = 26 \implies n = 27.

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers. Three fifths of the pairs are red and the rest are white. Two thirds of the pairs are high-top and the rest are low-top. The red high-top sneakers make up a fraction of the collection. What is the least possible value of this fraction?

Using exemplars:
1. Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers.
2. Three fifths (3/5) of these pairs are red, so 3/5 * 15 = 9 pairs are red.
3. The rest of the pairs are white, so 15 - 9 = 6 pairs are white.
4. Two thirds (2/3) of the pairs are high-top, so 2/3 * 15 = 10 pairs are high-top.
5. The rest of the pairs are low-top, so 15 - 10 = 5 pairs are low-top.
6. To find the fraction of red high-top sneakers, we need to determine how many pairs are both red and high-top. Since there are only 9 red pairs and 10 high-top pairs, at most 9 of them can be red and high-top (since there can't be more red high-top pairs than total red pairs).
7. Therefore, the least possible value for the fraction of red high-top sneakers is 9/15 = $$3/5$$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are red. Three fifths of Jordan's collection is red, so we calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) pairs of red sneakers.
2. Next, we determine how many pairs of sneakers are high-top. Two thirds of the collection is high-top, so we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10 \) pairs of high-top sneakers.
3. Now, we want to find the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection. To minimize this fraction, we maximize the number of non-red, non-high-top sneakers.
4. Since 9 pairs are red and 10 pairs are high-top, there must be at least \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) pairs of white sneakers (because at least 6 pairs are not red) and at least \( 15 - 10 = 5 \) pairs of low-top sneakers (because at least 5 pairs are not high-top).
5. Therefore, the maximum number of non-red, non-high-top sneakers is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) pairs. This means there are \( 15 - 11 = 4 \) pairs that could be red high-top sneakers.
6. Thus, the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers in Jordan's collection is \( \frac{4}{15} \).
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are red and white. Since three fifths of Jordan's sneakers are red, we calculate:
   Number of red pairs = (3/5) * Total number of pairs
   = (3/5) * 15
   = 9 pairs

2. This means that the rest of the sneakers must be white. So, the number of white pairs is:
   Number of white pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of red pairs
   = 15 - 9
   = 6 pairs

3. Next, let's find out how many pairs of sneakers are high-top and low-top. Since two thirds of Jordan's sneakers are high-top, we calculate:
   Number of high-top pairs = (2/3) * Total number of pairs
   = (2/3) * 15
   = 10 pairs

4. This means that the rest of the sneakers must be low-top. So, the number of low-top pairs is:
   Number of low-top pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of high-top pairs
   = 15 - 10
   = 5 pairs

5. Now, we need to find out how many red high-top sneakers there are. Since all the high-top sneakers could be white (the least possible), the number of red high-top sneakers is:
   Number of red high-top pairs = Minimum(Number of red pairs, Number of high-top pairs)
   = Minimum(9, 10)
   = 9 pairs

6. Finally, we can find out what fraction of the total collection these 9 pairs represent:
   Fraction of red high-top sneakers = Number of red high-top pairs / Total number of pairs
   = 9 / 15
   = 3/5

So, the least possible value for the fraction is $\boxed{3/5}$.

To find the least possible value for the fraction of red high-top sneakers, we need to determine the maximum number of non-red, non-high-top pairs.

1. Let's first calculate how many pairs are red:
   Number of red pairs = (3/5) * Total number of pairs
   = (3/5) * 15
   = 9 pairs

2. Since there are only two colors - red and white - the rest of the sneakers must be white, so:
   Number of white pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of red pairs
   = 15 - 9
   = 6 pairs

3. Next, let's find out how many high-top pairs:
   Number of high-top pairs = (2/3) * Total number of pairs
   = (2/3) * 15
   = 10 pairs

4. The rest of the sneakers must be low-top, so:
   Number of low-top pairs = Total number of pairs - Number of high-top pairs
   = 15 - 10
   = 5 pairs

5. To minimize the fraction of red high-top sneakers, we need to maximize the number of non-red, non-high-top pairs. The maximum number of these pairs is the sum of white and low-top pairs:
   Maximum number of non-red, non-high-top pairs = Number of white pairs + Number of low-top pairs
   = 6 + 5
   = 11 pairs

6. This means there are at least \( 15 - 11 = 4 \) pairs that could be red high-top sneakers.

7. Therefore, the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers is:
   Fraction of red high-top sneakers = Number of red high-top pairs / Total number of pairs
   = 4/15

So, the least possible value for the fraction is $$\frac{4}{15}$$.

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: A group of frogs (called an army) is living in a tree. A frog turns green when in the shade and turns yellow when in the sun. Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. Now the ratio is 4:1. What is the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now?

Using exemplars:
1. We start by letting the initial number of green frogs be $3x$ and the initial number of yellow frogs be $x$. This is because the ratio of green to yellow frogs was initially given as 3:1.

2. After the movement, there are three more yellow frogs than green frogs on the shady side. This can be represented as $(3x + 5) - (3x - 3)$.

3. Similarly, for the sunny side, there are fewer yellow frogs than green frogs by two. This can be represented as $x - (3x + 5)$.

4. The problem states that after the movement, the ratio of green to yellow frogs is now 4:1. So, we can set up the equation $(3x - 3) : (x - (3x + 5)) = 4 : 1$. This simplifies to $3x - 3 : (-2x - 5) = 4 : 1$.

5. Solving this proportion, we get $-2x - 5 = \frac{1}{4}(3x - 3)$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 6$.

6. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the current number of green frogs by substituting $x$ into $(3x - 3)$, which gives us $15$.

7. The current number of yellow frogs is $2x + 5$, which, when we substitute $x = 6$, gives us $17$.

8. Finally, to find the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now, we subtract the number of green frogs from the number of yellow frogs, which is $17 - 15 = 2$.

So, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is $\boxed{2}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the initial number of green frogs as G and the initial number of yellow frogs as Y. According to the problem, the initial ratio is 3:1, so we can write this relationship as G/Y = 3/1 or G = 3Y.

2. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. This changes the number of frogs in each group to G - 3 and Y + 5 respectively.

3. Now, the ratio is 4:1, so we can write this relationship as (G - 3)/(Y + 5) = 4/1 or G - 3 = 4(Y + 5).

4. We now have two equations with two variables: G = 3Y and G - 3 = 4(Y + 5).

5. Substitute the first equation into the second to get 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5), which simplifies to Y = 18.

6. Substitute Y back into the first equation to get G = 3*18 = 54.

7. Now we know that there are 54 green frogs and 18 yellow frogs. The difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs is 54 - 18 = 36.

The final answer is \boxed{36}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Initially, let's assume there are x green frogs and y yellow frogs in the tree. We know that the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1, so we can write an equation as follows:
x/y = 3/1
2. Solving for x gives us:
x = 3y
3. Then, 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. After moving, the number of green frogs became (x-3) and the number of yellow frogs became (y+5). We know that now the ratio is 4:1, so we can write another equation as follows:
(x-3)/(y+5) = 4/1
4. Substituting x=3y into this equation gives us:
(3y - 3)/(y + 5) = 4/1
5. Solving for y gives us:
y = 2
6. Then, substituting y=2 into the equation x=3y gives us:
x = 3 * 2 = 6
7. Now, we can find the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs after moving as follows:
Difference = (x-3) - (y+5)
8. Substituting x=6 and y=2 into this equation gives us:
Difference = (6-3) - (2+5)
9. Simplifying this equation gives us:
Difference = 3 - 7 = -4
10. Therefore, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is -4.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{-4} $$

$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{3}{1}$

2. Solving for $x$ gives us:
$x = 3y$

3. Then, 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. After moving, the number of green frogs became $(x-3)$ and the number of yellow frogs became $(y+5)$. We know that now the ratio is 4:1, so we can write another equation as follows:

4. Substituting $x=3y$ into this equation gives us:

$3y-3 = 4y+20$
$-3-20=4y-3y$
$-23=y$

6. Then, substituting $y=-23$ into the equation $x=3y$ gives us:
$x=3(-23)=-69$

7. Now, we can find the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs after moving as follows:
Difference = $(x-3)-(y+5)$
Difference =$((-69)-3)-((-23)+5)$

8. Simplifying this equation gives us:
Difference =$(-72)-(-18)$
 Difference $=-72 + 18$
 Difference $=-54$

The final answer is: $$ -54 $$

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: A small airplane has 4 rows of seats with 3 seats in each row. Eight passengers have boarded the plane and are distributed randomly among the seats. A married couple is next to board. What is the probability there will be 2 adjacent seats in the same row for the couple?

Using exemplars:
1. **Total number of ways the couple can sit**: The total number of ways to place the couple in any two seats is equal to the number of pairs of seats available on the plane.
2. **Number of favorable outcomes (2 adjacent seats)**: This depends on how we define "adjacent" - are they adjacent in the same row or across rows? For simplicity, let's assume we mean adjacent in the same row. There are 4 rows with 3 seats each, so there are 3 pairs of adjacent seats in each row, and a total of $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ pairs of adjacent seats on the plane.
3. **Calculating the probability**: The probability that the couple sits next to each other is then $\frac{12}{15} = \boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify the total number of ways to seat the eight passengers:** Since there are four rows with three seats each, and eight passengers, we first calculate the number of ways to arrange these passengers in the seats. This is a permutation problem, where order matters. We have 12 seats and 8 passengers, so the number of arrangements is given by the permutation formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items to choose from, and r is the number of items to choose. Here, n = 12 (seats) and r = 8 (passengers).
   \[
   \text{Total arrangements} = P(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{(12-8)!} = \frac{12!}{4!}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to place the married couple:** The couple can be placed in any two adjacent seats in a row. Since there are 3 seats in each row, and they must sit next to each other, we treat them as a single entity first. This leaves us with 7 entities to arrange (the couple and the other 6 passengers). We now have 10 slots (4 rows * 3 seats/row - 2 seats occupied by the couple) to place these 7 entities. The number of ways to do this is given by P(10, 7).
   \[
   \text{Arrangements for the couple} = P(10, 7) = \frac{10!}{(10-7)!} = \frac{10!}{3!}
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:** The probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible arrangements.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Arrangements for the couple}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{P(10, 7)}{P(12, 8)} = \frac{\frac{10!}{3!}}{\frac{12!}{4!}}
   \]

4. **Simplify and calculate:** Simplifying the expression gives us the probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{10!}{3!}}{\frac{12!}{4!}} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5} = \frac{3}{11}
   \]

5. **Final answer:** The probability that the married couple will be seated next to each other is $\boxed{\frac{3}{11}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's calculate the total number of ways to arrange the eight passengers. Since there are 4 rows and each row has 3 seats, there are a total of 12 seats (4 * 3). The number of ways to choose 8 seats out of 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of arrangements is C(12, 8).

2. Next, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange the eight passengers such that the married couple has two adjacent seats in the same row. There are 4 rows, and for each row, there are 3 pairs of adjacent seats (since a row has only 3 seats). So, there are 12 possible positions for the married couple's seats.

3. Once the married couple's seats are fixed, the remaining 6 passengers can be arranged in the remaining 10 seats in C(10, 6) ways.

4. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes (arrangements where the married couple has two adjacent seats in the same row) is 12 * C(10, 6).

5. The probability that the married couple will have 2 adjacent seats in the same row is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability P = (12 * C(10, 6)) / C(12, 8).

Final answer: \boxed{P = (12 * C(10, 6)) / C(12, 8)}

## Step 1
The total number of ways to arrange eight passengers in twelve seats can be calculated using combinations.

## Step 2
There are four rows with three seats each. For each row, we have the possibility of choosing two adjacent seats for the couple out of three possible seat pairs per row. As there are four rows, this gives us a total number of arrangements for the couple to sit next to each other in the same row as 12.

## Step 3
We need to calculate the probability that the married couple will have two adjacent seats in the same row.

## Step 4
The number of favorable outcomes is given by $12$, and we also need to find the total number of possible arrangements. The combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose k items from n items without considering order, can be used to calculate this total.

## Step 5
To find the probability that the married couple will have two adjacent seats in the same row, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of arrangements. This means our final probability is $\frac{12 * C(10, 6)}{C(12, 8)}$.

## Step 6
Now, let's calculate $C(12, 8)$ and $C(10, 6)$. These are combinations that can be calculated as follows: 
    - $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
    
Thus,
    - $C(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{8!(12-8)!}$ and
    - $C(10, 6) = \frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!}$.

## Step 7
Using the formula for combinations:
$C(12, 8) = \frac{12!}{8!(4!)}$

and

$C(10, 6) = \frac{10!}{6!(4!)}$, we can calculate these values.


## Step 8
We can also simplify $C(12, 8)$ and $C(10, 6)$ to get:
$\frac{12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5}{4 * 3 * 2}$ for $C(12, 8)$ and $\frac{10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5}{4 * 3 * 2}$ for $C(10, 6)$. 

## Step 9
Substituting these values into our expression gives us the final probability: $$\frac{12*C(10, 6)}{C(12, 8)} = \frac{12*\frac{10!}{6!(4!)}}{\frac{12!}{8!(4!)}}$$

## Step 10
Cancel out the (4!) terms and simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by $6!\cdot 8!: \frac{12\cdot(10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7)}{12\cdot11\cdot10} = \boxed{\frac{3}{11}}$$
Answer: \frac{12*C(10, 6)}{C(12, 8)} = \frac{12*\frac{10!}{6!(4!)}}{\frac{12!}{8!(4!)}} vs Expected: 20/33 | Accuracy: 7.1%

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: Wind chill is a measure of how cold people feel when exposed to wind outside. A good estimate for wind chill can be found using this calculation (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed) where temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed is measured in miles per hour (mph). Suppose the air temperature is 36 degrees F and the wind speed is 18 mph. Which of the following is closest to the approximate wind chill?

Using exemplars:
1. Identify the given values for the calculation: Air temperature = 36°F, Wind speed = 18 mph.
2. Plug these values into the wind chill formula: (Wind chill) = (36°F) - 0.7 * (18 mph).
3. Calculate the product of 0.7 and 18 mph, which is 12.6 mph.
4. Subtract this value from the air temperature: 36°F - 12.6 mph = 23.4°F.

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: A lake contains 250 trout, along with a variety of other fish. When a marine biologist catches and releases a sample of 180 fish from the lake, 30 are identified as trout. Assume that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. How many fish are there in the lake?

Using exemplars:
1. We know that 30 out of the 180 fish caught by the marine biologist are trout, so the ratio of trout to total fish in the sample is 30/180.
2. Since we assume the ratio of trout to total fish is the same in both the sample and the lake, we can set up a proportion: (trout in sample) / (total fish in sample) = (trout in lake) / (total fish in lake). Plugging in the numbers gives us 30/180 = 250/(total fish in lake).
3. Solving for "total fish in lake", we get: total fish in lake = 250 * (180/30) = 1500.
4. Therefore, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{1500} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. This means that the proportion of trout in the sample should be equal to the proportion of trout in the entire lake.
2. We can express this relationship as a proportion: (number of trout in the sample / total number of fish in the sample) = (number of trout in the lake / total number of fish in the lake).
3. Substituting the given values into the proportion, we get: (30 / 180) = (250 / x), where x is the total number of fish in the lake.
4. Simplifying the left side of the equation gives us: (1/6) = (250 / x).
5. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and get: 250 * 6 = 1 * x.
6. This simplifies to: 1500 = x.
7. Therefore, the total number of fish in the lake is $$ \boxed{1500} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish in the sample is the same as in the lake. In the sample, there are 30 trout out of a total of 180 fish. So, the ratio is 30/180 = 1/6.
2. This means that for every 6 fish in the lake, one is a trout. Therefore, to find out how many fish there are in total in the lake, we need to multiply the number of trout by 6.
3. There are 250 trout in the lake. So, the total number of fish in the lake is 250 * 6 = 1500.

The final answer is $$ \boxed{1500} $$.

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Harold made a plum pie to take on a picnic. He was able to eat only 1/4 of the pie, and he left the rest for his friends. A moose came by and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. After that, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. How much of the original pie still remained after the porcupine left?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how much pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate 1/4 of the pie, his friends got 3/4 of it.
2. Then, the moose came and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. So, the moose ate 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4 of the original pie.
3. After the moose, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. The moose had eaten 1/4 of the pie, so the porcupine ate 1/3 * 1/4 = 1/12 of the original pie.
4. To find out how much pie is left after the porcupine, we subtract what the moose and the porcupine ate from what Harold left behind: (3/4 - 1/4) - 1/12 = 1/2 - 1/12 = 6/12 - 1/12 = 5/12 of the original pie.

So, the final answer is \boxed{5/12}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's determine how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate 1/4 of the pie, the remaining fraction would be 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.
2. Next, we need to find out how much of the pie was left after the moose ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. So, we multiply the amount left by Harold (3/4) by 2/3 (since 1 - 1/3 = 2/3), which results in (3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2.
3. Finally, we need to calculate how much of the original pie was still remaining after the porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. To do this, we multiply the amount left by the moose (1/2) by 2/3 (since 1 - 1/3 = 2/3), which results in (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3.
4. Therefore, $$ \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} $$ of the original pie remained after the porcupine left.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate only 1/4 of it, his friends got the remaining 3/4 (because 1 - 1/4 = 3/4).
2. Next, let's calculate how much the moose ate from the leftovers. The moose ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind, which was 3/4 of the pie. So, the moose ate (1/3) * (3/4) = 9/12 = 3/4 of a pie.
3. After the moose ate, there was (3/4) - (3/4) = 0 left for Harold's friends.
4. Now, let's see how much the porcupine ate from what the moose left behind. The porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left, which is (1/3) * (3/4) = 9/12 = 3/4 of a pie.
5. Therefore, after all these events, there was no pie left for Harold's friends or any other animal because both Harold and the moose ate all of it.

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: NASA's Perseverance Rover was launched on July 30 2020 After traveling 292,526,838 miles, it landed on Mars in Jezero Crater about 6.5 months later. Which of the following is closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to calculate the total time it took for the Perseverance Rover to travel from Earth to Mars. It was launched on July 30, 2020, and landed on Mars on February 18,

21. That's a bit more than 6.5 months. To be exact, it's 7 months and 19 days.

2. Next, we convert this time into hours. We know that:
   - 1 month has approximately 30 days.
   - 1 day has 24 hours.

So, the total time in hours is (7 * 30 + 19) * 24 = 6456 hours.

3. Now, we can calculate the average speed of the rover by dividing the total distance it traveled by the total time it took. The rover traveled 292,526,838 miles in 6456 hours.

4. So, the average speed is 292,526,838 / 6456 = 45,308 miles per hour.

Therefore, the closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour is $\boxed{45,308}$ mph.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many hours it took for the rover to travel that distance. Since there are approximately 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows:
   Total hours = 6.5 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day
   = 4776 hours

2. Next, we divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to find the average speed in miles per hour:
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   = 292,526,838 miles / 4776 hours
   ≈ 61,262.6 miles/hour

So, the closest value to the Rover's average interplanetary speed is approximately $61,262.6$ miles per hour.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find out how many hours have passed from July 30, 2020 to January 7, 2021 (about 6.5 months later). There are approximately 88 days in 6.5 months, and each day has 24 hours:

Days = 88
   Hours per Day = 24
   Total Hours = Days * Hours per Day
   = 88 * 24
   = 2112 hours

2. Next, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken:

Speed = Distance / Time
    = 292,526,838 miles / 2112 hours
    ≈ 138,564.78 miles per hour (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{138564.78} $$

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took for the Perseverance Rover to travel from Earth to Mars.

1. First, we convert 6.5 months into days:
   - There are approximately 30 days in a month.
   - So, 6.5 months is equal to (6 * 30) + 15 = 195 days.

2. Next, we calculate the total number of hours by multiplying the total number of days by the number of hours per day:

Total Hours = Total Days * Hours/Day
           = 195 * 24
           = 4680 hours

3. Now, we can calculate the average speed of the rover by dividing the total distance it traveled (292,526,838 miles) by the total time it took (4680 hours):

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
             = 292,526,838 / 4680
             ≈ 62,555.8 miles per hour

Therefore, the closest value to the Rover's average interplanetary speed is approximately $$ \boxed{62555.8} $$

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps, with exactly 20 of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We have three types of stamps: 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps. Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type.

2. The goal is to find the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage.

3. To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of these three types of stamps that would add up to $7.10.

4. Let's start with the 25-cent stamp. If we use one 25-cent stamp, we still need $6.85 ($7.10 - $0.25).

5. Now, let's consider the 10-cent and 5-cent stamps. We can make $6.85 using two 25-cent stamps (which is not possible as we only have one), four 10-cent stamps ($0.40 * 4 = $1.60) and nine 5-cent stamps ($0.05 * 9 = $0.45). This makes a total of $2.05, which is less than $6.85.

6. If we use three 10-cent stamps instead of four, we get $1.20 ($0.40 * 3). Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.65, which is still less than $6.85.

7. If we use two 10-cent stamps, we get $0.80 ($0.40 * 2). Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.35, which is closer but still less than $6.85.

8. If we use one 10-cent stamp, we get $0.40. Adding this to the nine 5-cent stamps gives us $1.05, which is still less than $6.85.

9. Therefore, the only way to make exactly $7.10 using these stamps is to use one 25-cent stamp and then fill the rest of the amount with 10-cent and 5-cent stamps.

10. So, we use one 25-cent stamp, four 10-cent stamps ($0.40 * 4 = $1.60), and nine 5-cent stamps ($0.05 * 9 = $0.45). This makes a total of $2.05 + $7.10 - $0.25 = $8.90, which is not equal to $7.10.

11. Therefore, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is 43 (1 * 25 + 4 * 10 + 9 * 5).

\boxed{43}
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the number of 5-cent stamps as x, 10-cent stamps as y, and 25-cent stamps as z. We know that Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp, so we have three equations:
x + y + z = 20 (total number of stamps)
   The cost equation is:
   0.05x + 0.1y + 0.25z = 7.10 (the total cost in cents)

2. We can simplify the equations by multiplying everything by 100 to get rid of decimals, which gives us:
5x + 10y + 25z = 710
   x + y + z = 20

3. Now let's try to maximize the number of stamps (x + y + z). From the first equation, we know that x, y, and z must all be less than or equal to 20. Let's start by using as many 5-cent stamps as possible:
   5x = 710 - 10y - 25z
   Since x must be an integer, we can only have integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5. The smallest such value is when y = 0 and z = 0, which gives us:
   5x = 710 - 10(0) - 25(0) = 710
   So x = 142, but this is not possible since x must be less than or equal to 20. Let's try the next smallest value for y and z:
   y = 1, z = 1 (so we use one 10-cent stamp and one 25-cent stamp)
   5x = 710 - 10(1) - 25(1) = 685
   So x = 137, but again this is not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

4. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 19 and z = 0 (so we use all 19 ten-cent stamps and no twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(19) - 25(0) = 695
   So x = 139, but again this is not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

5. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 19 and z = 1 (so we use all 19 ten-cent stamps and one twenty-five-cent stamp), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(19) - 25(1) = 665
   So x = 133, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

8. After trying different combinations of y and z, we find that when y = 17 and z = 3 (so we use all 17 ten-cent stamps and three twenty-five-cent stamps), the equation becomes:
   5x = 710 - 10(17) - 25(3) = 630
   So x = 126, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

    5x = 710 - 10(15) - 25(7) = 530
   So x = 106, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

    5x = 710 - 10(15) - 25(8) = 495
   So x = 99, which is still not possible. We need to find integer values for y and z that make the right side of the equation divisible by 5 and result in an x value less than or equal to 20.

\boxed{19}
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify Variables:** Let's denote the number of 5-cent stamps as \(x\), 10-cent stamps as \(y\), and 25-cent stamps as \(z\).

2. **Set Up Equation:** The total value of all stamps Nicolas can use is $7.10, which translates to 710 cents. Therefore, the equation representing this scenario is:
   \[
   5x + 10y + 25z = 710
   \]

3. **Consider Constraints:** Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp, so \(x \leq 20\), \(y \leq 20\), and \(z \leq 20\). We need to find the maximum value of \(x + y + z\) under these constraints.

4. **Simplify Equation:** To simplify, we can divide the entire equation by 5:
   \[
   x + 2y + 5z = 142
   \]

5. **Maximize \(x + y + z\):** Since \(z\) is multiplied by 5 in the simplified equation, we should maximize \(z\) to get the largest possible \(x + y + z\). The maximum value of \(z\) is 20 (since Nicolas has exactly 20 of each type of stamp).

6. **Substitute and Solve:** Substituting \(z = 20\) into the simplified equation:
   \[
   x + 2y + 5(20) = 142 \implies x + 2y + 100 = 142 \implies x + 2y = 42
   \]

7. **Maximize \(x + y\):** Since \(x \leq 20\) and \(y \leq 20\), we need to find the maximum value of \(x + y\) that satisfies \(x + 2y = 42\). The maximum value occurs when \(x = 20\) (since increasing \(x\) decreases \(y\) but does not exceed its limit).

8. **Final Calculation:** Substituting \(x = 20\) into \(x + 2y = 42\):
   \[
   20 + 2y = 42 \implies 2y = 22 \implies y = 11
   \]

9. **Sum Up Stamps:** The total number of stamps used is:
   \[
   x + y + z = 20 + 11 + 20 = 51
   \]

Therefore, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is \(\boxed{51}\).
