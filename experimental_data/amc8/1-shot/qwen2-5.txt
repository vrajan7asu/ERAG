Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: What is the value of this expression in decimal form? 44/11 + 110/44 + 44/1100

Using exemplars:
1. First, we simplify each fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each pair of numbers in the numerator and denominator.
   - GCD(44, 11) = 11, so 44/11 becomes 4/1.
   - GCD(110, 44) = 22, so 110/44 becomes 5/2.
   - GCD(44, 1100) = 44, so 44/1100 becomes 1/25.

2. Now we have the simplified fractions: 4/1 + 5/2 + 1/25.

3. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50. So we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
   - 4/1 becomes 200/50.
   - 5/2 becomes 125/50.
   - 1/25 becomes 2/50.

4. Finally, we add these fractions together: 200/50 + 125/50 + 2/50 = 327/50.

5. To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 327 ÷ 50 = 6.54.

So, the value of the expression in decimal form is \boxed{6.54}.

Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Simplify each fraction individually:**

   - For \( \frac{44}{11} \):
     \[
     \text{GCD}(44, 11) = 11 
     \]
     Dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{44}{11} = \frac{44 \div 11}{11 \div 11} = 4
     \]

   - For \( \frac{110}{44} \):
     \[
     \text{GCD}(110, 44) = 22 
     \]
     Dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{110}{44} = \frac{110 \div 22}{44 \div 22} = \frac{5}{2}
     \]

   - For \( \frac{44}{1100} \):
     \[
     \text{GCD}(44, 1100) = 44 
     \]
     Dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{44}{1100} = \frac{44 \div 44}{1100 \div 44} = \frac{1}{25}
     \]

2. **Now we have simplified fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{44}{11} + \frac{110}{44} + \frac{44}{1100} = 4 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{25}
   \]

3. **To add these fractions, we need a common denominator:**
   - The denominators are 1, 2, and 25. 
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50.

   Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 50:
   \[
   4 = \frac{4 \times 50}{50} = \frac{200}{50}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 25}{2 \times 25} = \frac{125}{50}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{25} = \frac{1 \times 2}{25 \times 2} = \frac{2}{50}
   \]

4. **Now add these fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{200}{50} + \frac{125}{50} + \frac{2}{50} = \frac{200 + 125 + 2}{50} = \frac{327}{50}
   \]

5. **Convert the resulting fraction to decimal form:**
   \[
   \frac{327}{50} = 6.54
   \]

So, the value of the expression in decimal form is:
\[
\boxed{6.54}

   - For \( \frac{110}{44} \):
     \[
     \text{GCD}(110, 44) = 22 
     \]
     Dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{110}{44} = \frac{110 \div 22}{44 \div 22} = \frac{5}{2}

     \]

2. **Now we have simplified fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{44}{11} + \frac{110}{44} + \frac{44}{1100} = 4 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{25}

   \frac{1}{25} = \frac{1 \times 2}{25 \times 2} = \frac{2}{50}
   \]

4. **Now add these fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{200}{50} + \frac{125}{50} + \frac{2}{50} = \frac{200 + 125 + 2}{50} = \frac{327}{50}
   \]

5. **Convert the resulting fraction to decimal form:**
   \[
   \frac{327}{50} = 6.54

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: When Yunji added all the integers from 1 to 9, she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 9. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. In this case, n=9.
   Sum = 9*(9+1)/2 = 45

2. Next, we need to find a square number that could be the result of an incorrect sum due to one number being left out. Since the numbers from 1 to 9 add up to 45, leaving out one number would mean the incorrect sum is one less than 45, which is 44.

3. However, 44 is not a square number. We need to find the smallest square number greater than 44 that could be a possible incorrect sum. The next square number after 44 is 49 (7^2). So, Yunji might have left out two numbers instead of one.

4. If Yunji left out two numbers from the sequence, we need to find which two numbers she could have left out such that their sum is equal to 45 minus the square number 49. In other words, we need to find two numbers x and y such that x + y = 45 - 49 = -4.

5. The only pair of integers between 1 and 9 whose sum equals -4 is (3, -7). However, since we are considering positive integers from 1 to 9, the number that Yunji left out should be negative in this context. But we know that there's no negative integer from 1 to 9.

6. Therefore, our assumption of leaving out two numbers is incorrect. Let's go back and check for one number being left out. Since 45 is not a square number, let's find the next possible square number greater than 45. The next square number after 45 is 64 (8^2).

7. Now we need to find which single number was left out such that the sum of the remaining numbers equals 64. In other words, we need to find a number x such that 45 - x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = -19, which is not within our range of integers from 1 to 9.

8. Therefore, there's no single integer from 1 to 9 that Yunji could have left out to result in a square number when summing the remaining integers. However, if we consider leaving out two numbers again, then we can find a solution:

- If Yunji left out both 4 and 5, the sum of the remaining numbers would be 45 - (4 + 5) = 36, which is a square number (6^2).

Final answer: $$ \boxed{4} $$ and $$ \boxed{5} $$, as leaving out both these numbers results in an incorrect sum that is a square number.

To solve this problem, we will follow a similar approach as provided in the example.

1. **Calculate the total sum of all integers from 1 to 9:**
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n = 9 \).

   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{9(9+1)}{2} = \frac{9 \times 10}{2} = 45
   \]

2. **Determine the incorrect sum that is a square number:**
   - Since Yunji left out one number, her correct sum (if she hadn't omitted any) would be \( 45 \).
   - The incorrect sum will then be \( 45 - x \), where \( x \) is the number left out.
   - The incorrect sum must be a square number. Let’s find the smallest such square number greater than \( 45 \).

3. **Identify the next possible square number greater than \( 45 \):**
   - Next square numbers are \( 64 \) (since \( 8^2 = 64 \)), which is greater than \( 45 \).
   
4. **Determine the number left out:**
   - If \( 45 - x = 64 \):
     \[
     x = 45 - 64 = -19
     \]
   - Since we are looking for a positive integer from \( 1 \) to \( 9 \), \( -19 \) is not within our range. Therefore, \( x \neq -19 \).

5. **Verify the next possible square number:**
   - The next possible square number after \( 64 \) would be greater than \( 64 \). We need to check previous candidates for a valid \( x \).
   - For the next lower candidate, consider if there is another pair of numbers that can sum up to reduce \( 45 \):
   
   Let's verify by checking different pairs:
   - Consider leaving out two numbers instead.
   - Assume Yunji left out \( 3 \) and another number. Then the incorrect sum would be \( 45 - (3 + y) = k^2 \), where \( k^2 > 45 \).

6. **Finding specific pair:**
   - Let’s try with numbers like \( 3 \) and see what happens:
     If Yunji left out \( 3 \):
     \[
     45 - 3 = 42
     \]
   - Next square number greater than \( 42 \) is not a simple increment. So, let's find valid pairs.

7. **Valid pair:**
   - Trying leaving out \( 3 \) and another integer:
     \[
     45 - (3 + y) = k^2
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     - Suppose we leave out \( 4 \), then the sum of remaining numbers is:
       \[
       45 - 4 = 41
       \]
       Not a perfect square.
   
8. **Valid and confirmed solution:**
   - Checking valid combinations, if Yunji left out \( 4 \) and another number like \( 5 \):
     \[
     45 - (4 + 5) = 36
     \]
     Which is a perfect square (\( 6^2 = 36 \)).

Therefore, the number that Yunji must have left out to achieve an incorrect sum as a square number is:
$$ \boxed{4} $$ and \( \boxed{5} \).

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice. She notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. Which of the following integers cannot be the sum of the two numbers?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's consider the possible outcomes when rolling two standard 6-sided dice that would result in a product being a multiple of

6. The pairs of rolls that give a product divisible by 6 are: (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,2), (3,6), (4,3), (4,6), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and (6,6).

2. Now, let's calculate the sum of each pair: 7, 5, 8, 5, 9, 7, 10, 7, 9, 11, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.

3. From these sums, we can see that all integers from 5 to 12 are possible sums of the two numbers rolled, except for 4.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{4} $$ cannot be the sum of the two numbers Aaliyah rolled if their product is a multiple of 6.

To solve this problem, let's first understand the conditions under which the product of the numbers on two dice rolled is a multiple of 6. The number 6 can be factored into prime factors as \(2 \times 3\). Therefore, for the product to be a multiple of 6, both dice must contribute at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3.

A standard six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. Here are the numbers that are multiples of 2 (even) and those that are multiples of 3:

- Multiples of 2: {2, 4, 6}
- Multiples of 3: {3, 6}

We need at least one even number and one multiple of 3 in order for the product to be a multiple of 6.

Let's analyze all possible sums (of two numbers from 1 to 6) given these conditions:

1. If both dice show multiples of 2: Possible pairs are (2,2), (4,4), (6,6).
   - Sums: 4, 8, 12

2. If one die shows a multiple of 2 and the other shows a multiple of 3:
   - Pairs (excluding duplicates): (2,3), (2,6), (3,2), (3,6), (6,2), (6,3).
   - Sums: 5, 8, 5, 9, 8, 9

3. If both dice show a multiple of 3 but not 6:
   - Possible pairs: (3,3).

Let's list the unique sums from these possibilities:
- From step 1 and step 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
- From step 3: 5, 8, 9

From this analysis, we see that the possible sums are {4, 5, 8, 9}. The only integer from the set of all possible dice rolls (1 through 6) that is not included in these sums is:

$$ \boxed{1} $$

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: On Monday, Taye has $2. Every day, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. How many different dollar amounts could Taye have on Thursday, 3 days later?

Using exemplars:
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. On Tuesday, he can either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Monday. So, the possible amounts he could have are $2 + $3 = $5 or $2 * 2 = $4.
3. On Wednesday, he can again either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Tuesday. So, for each amount he had on Tuesday ($5 or $4), the possible amounts he could have on Wednesday are $5 + $3 = $8 or $5 * 2 = $10 and $4 + $3 = $7 or $4 * 2 = $8.
4. On Thursday, he can again either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Wednesday. So, for each amount he had on Wednesday ($8, $10, $7, or $8), the possible amounts he could have on Thursday are $8 + $3 = $11, $8 * 2 = $16, $10 + $3 = $13, $10 * 2 = $20, $7 + $3 = $10, $7 * 2 = $14, and again $8 + $3 = $11.
5. Therefore, the possible amounts of money Taye could have on Thursday are $11, $16, $13, $20, $10, and $14.

The final answer is that there are 6 different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday: $$ \boxed{11}, \boxed{16}, \boxed{13}, \boxed{20}, \boxed{10}, \boxed{14} $$.

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine all possible amounts of money Taye could have on Thursday.

1. **Monday:**  
   Taye starts with $2.
   
2. **Tuesday:**  
   On Tuesday, he can either gain $3 or double his amount from Monday. 
   - If he gains $3: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)
   - If he doubles the money: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)

So on Tuesday, Taye could have:
- $5
- $4

3. **Wednesday:**  
   On Wednesday, Taye can either gain $3 or double his amount from Tuesday.
   
   For each of the two possible amounts from Tuesday:
   - If he has $5 (Tuesday): \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) and \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \)
   - If he has $4 (Tuesday): \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) and \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)

So on Wednesday, the possible amounts are:
- $8
- $10
- $7

4. **Thursday:**  
   On Thursday, Taye can either gain $3 or double his amount from Wednesday.
   
   For each of the three possible amounts from Wednesday:
   - If he has $8 (Wednesday): \( 8 + 3 = 11 \) and \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
   - If he has $10 (Wednesday): \( 10 + 3 = 13 \) and \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)
   - If he has $7 (Wednesday): \( 7 + 3 = 10 \) and \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \)

So on Thursday, the possible amounts are:
- $11
- $16
- $13
- $20
- $10
- $14

### Conclusion:
The different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday are: 
$$ 11, 16, 13, 20, 10, 14 $$

Therefore, there are 6 different possible amounts of money Taye could have on Thursday.

1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G.
2. According to the problem, Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles. So, the number of red marbles is (G/2).
3. The problem also states that Maria has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Therefore, the number of blue marbles is 2G.
4. To find the total number of marbles, we add up the number of red, green, and blue marbles: (G/2) + G + 2G = (5/2) * G.
5. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be a multiple of 2. Let's try different multiples of 2 for G and see if the total number of marbles is a whole number.
6. If G = 2, then the total number of marbles is (5/2) * 2 = 5. This is a possible answer because 5 is a whole number.
7. Therefore, Maria could have 5 marbles in her collection. The final answer is: $$ \boxed{5} $$

Let's denote the number of green marbles as \( G \).

According to the problem:
1. The number of red marbles is half the number of green marbles, so it is \( \frac{G}{2} \).
2. The number of blue marbles is twice the number of green marbles, so it is \( 2G \).

To find the total number of marbles, we add up the number of red, green, and blue marbles:
\[ G + \frac{G}{2} + 2G = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + 2\right)G = \frac{7}{2}G. \]

For the total number of marbles to be a whole number, \( \frac{7}{2}G \) must also be a whole number. This implies that \( G \) must be a multiple of 2.

Let's try different multiples of 2 for \( G \):

1. If \( G = 2 \):
\[ \text{Total marbles} = \frac{7}{2} \times 2 = 7. \]

Since we need to find which of the provided options could be correct, let’s check if \( G = 4 \) is a valid option:

2. If \( G = 4 \):
\[ \text{Total marbles} = \frac{7}{2} \times 4 = 14. \]

Given the choices, we see that both 5 and 7 are possible totals for Maria's collection based on our calculations.

Now let's verify if there could be another reasonable answer by trying \( G = 6 \):

3. If \( G = 6 \):
\[ \text{Total marbles} = \frac{7}{2} \times 6 = 21. \]

Given the choices, we see that all provided options (5, 7, and 14) could be valid totals for Maria’s collection.

Therefore, one of the possible total numbers of marbles in Maria's collection is:
$$ \boxed{5} $$

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: In January 1980 the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of 338 ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average (CO2) reading has increased by about 1.515 ppm each year. What is the expected CO2 level in ppm in January 2030? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed since January 1980 until January 2030. That's 50 years.
2. Next, we calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 50 years by multiplying the yearly increase (1.515 ppm) by the number of years (50). So, $1.515 \times 50 = 75.75$ ppm.
3. Finally, we add this total increase to the initial CO2 level in January 1980 (338 ppm) to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030. So, $338 + 75.75 = 413.75$ ppm.

The expected CO2 level in January 2030 is approximately $$ \boxed{414} $$ parts per million.

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: The coordinates of triangle ABC are A(5,7), B(11,7), and C(3,y), with y > 7. The area of triangle ABC is 12. What is the value of y?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find the height of the triangle using point B as the base. Since points A and B have the same y-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference in their x-coordinates. So, the length of AB (the base) is |5 - 11| = 6 units.

2. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2. We know that the area is 12 and the base is 6, so we can set up an equation to solve for the height: 12 = (6 * h) / 2 => h = 4 units.

3. Since the height of the triangle is perpendicular to the base, we can use it as a reference to find the y-coordinate of point C. The difference between the y-coordinates of points B and C is equal to the height of the triangle. So, y = 7 + h (where h is the height) = 7 + 4 = \boxed{11}.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Find the length of AB as the base**:
   - Coordinates of A are \( (5, 7) \).
   - Coordinates of B are \( (11, 7) \).
   - The x-coordinates of A and B are the same since they both have y-coordinate equal to 7.
   - Therefore, the length of AB is the difference in their x-coordinates: 
     \[
     |11 - 5| = 6
     \]

2. **Using the area formula**:
   The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, the base AB is 6 units and the area is given as 12. Therefore, we set up the equation to solve for height \( h \):
   \[
   12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
   \]

3. **Solve for height \( h \)**:
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   12 = 3h
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   h = 4
   \]

4. **Determine y-coordinate of C**:
   - Since the height is perpendicular to AB and the height \( h \) is 4 units, we use this information to find the y-coordinate of point C.
   - The difference in y-coordinates between points B (with y = 7) and C will be equal to the height:
     \[
     |y - 7| = 4
     \]
   Given \( y > 7 \), we have:
     \[
     y - 7 = 4 \implies y = 11
     \]

Therefore, the value of \( y \) is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Find the length of AB as the base**:
   - Coordinates of A are \( (5, 7) \).
   - Coordinates of B are \( (11, 7) \).
   - The x-coordinates of A and B are the same since they both have y-coordinate equal to 7.
   - Therefore, the length of AB is the difference in their x-coordinates: 
     \[
     |11 - 5| = 6
     \]

2. **Using the area formula**:
   The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, the base AB is 6 units and the area is given as 12. Therefore, we set up the equation to solve for height \( h \):
   \[
   12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
   \]

3. **Solve for height \( h \)**:
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   12 = 3h
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   h = 4
   \]

4. **Determine y-coordinate of C**:
   - Since the height is perpendicular to AB and the height \( h \) is 4 units, we use this information to find the y-coordinate of point C.
   - The difference in y-coordinates between points B (with y = 7) and C will be equal to the height:
     \[
     |y - 7| = 4
     \]
   Given \( y > 7 \), we have:
     \[
     y - 7 = 4 \implies y = 11

Therefore, the value of \( y \) is:

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: Rohan keeps a total of 90 guppies in 4 fish tanks. There is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank. There are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank. How many guppies are in the 4th tank?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as $x$. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first, so we can denote the number of guppies in the second tank as $(x + 1)$.
2. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second, so we can denote the number of guppies in the third tank as $((x + 1) + 2 = x + 3)$.
3. And finally, there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third, so we can denote the number of guppies in the fourth tank as $((x + 3) + 3 = x + 6)$.
4. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given to be 90. So, we can set up the following equation: $x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90$.
5. Solving this equation gives us $4x + 10 = 90$, which simplifies to $4x = 80$. So, $x = 20$.
6. Substituting $x = 20$ into our expression for the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we get $20 + 6 = \boxed{26}$ guppies.

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Let the letters F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits. Suppose F L Y F L Y is the greatest number that satisfies the equation FLYFLY = BUGBUG. What is the value of FLY + BUG?

Using exemplars:
1. We know that F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G, which means both sides are six-digit numbers.
2. Since the left side has two F's, one L, and one Y, it suggests that BUGBUG should also have the same pattern but with different digits to ensure distinctness. This leads us to the conclusion that the right side must be a multiple of 10101 (since multiplying any number by 10101 shifts its digits two places to the left and appends them again on the right).
3. The largest six-digit multiple of 10101 is 99999 * 10101 = 999990001.
4. From this, we find that F = 9, L = 9, Y = 0, B = 8, U = 9, and G = 0. However, since the digits must be distinct, this solution doesn't work because both 9 and 0 are repeated.
5. So, we need to find the next largest multiple of 10101, which is 99989 * 10101 = 999890001.
6. Now, F = 9, L = 9, Y = 0, B = 8, U = 7, and G = 1. This solution satisfies the distinctness condition.
7. Therefore, FLY + BUG = 900 + 871 = 1771.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest six-digit number where the digits are repeated in a specific pattern (F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G). This implies that both sides of the equation are multiples of 10101 because multiplying any six-digit number by 10101 shifts its digits two places to the left and appends them again on the right. 

Let's start from the largest possible six-digit multiple of 10101, which is \(99999 \times 10101\):

\[ 99999 \times 10101 = 999989799 \]

We need to check if this number satisfies the condition. The number should be in the format FLYFLY, and thus we can rewrite it as \(F \)L\ )Y\)FL\ ((Y) where L is a repeated digit. 

Examining 999897999:
- It is not an exact six-digit multiple of 10101, so let's try the next largest possible multiple: 
\[ 99989 \times 10101 = 999889799 \]

Let’s verify this number to see if it fits FLYFLY format and satisfies all conditions.

- Check whether each digit is distinct: F=9, L=9, Y=8, B=8, U=7, G=9
- The digits are not distinct because both 9 and 8 appear more than once, which violates the condition of distinctness.
  
Next, let's consider another number: 
\[ 99988 \times 10101 = 999889798 \]

Checking this:
- F=9, L=9, Y=8, B=8, U=7, G=9
- Both 9 and 8 appear again. This still doesn't work.

Next number: 
\[ 99987 \times 10101 = 999879798 \]

Checking this:
- F=9, L=9, Y=7, B=8, U=7, G=9
- Both 9 and 8 appear again. This also doesn't work.

Next number: 
\[ 99986 \times 10101 = 999869798 \]

Checking this:
- F=9, L=9, Y=6, B=8, U=7, G=9
- Here all digits are distinct and fitting pattern.

Therefore the largest number meeting the criteria is:
\[ FLYFLY = 999869798 \]

Now we need to find \( FLY + BUG \):
- F=9, L=9, Y=6: 
- B=8, U=7, G=9

So,
\[ FLY = 99986 \]
\[ BUG = 8799 \]

Adding them:
\[ 99986 + 8799 = 108785 \]

Thus, the value of \( FLY + BUG \) is:

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: Minh enters the numbers 1 through 81 into the cells of a 9x9 grid in some order. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. What is the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding Divisibility by 3**: A product is divisible by 3 if at least one of the factors in the product is divisible by 3. In the range of numbers from 1 to 81, there are 27 numbers that are divisible by 3 (since every third number in this sequence is divisible by 3).

2. **Minimum Requirement for Divisibility**: To ensure a product is divisible by 3, at least one number in the set of factors must be divisible by 3. This means that each row and column can contribute at least one number divisible by 3 to the product.

3. **Maximizing Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: If we want to minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3, we should maximize the number of rows and columns without any number divisible by 3. This would mean having rows or columns composed entirely of numbers not divisible by 3.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: There are 54 numbers from 1 to 81 that are not divisible by 3 (since there are 27 numbers divisible by 3). If we arrange these 54 numbers in rows and columns without any number divisible by 3, the maximum number of rows or columns we can have without a product divisible by 3 is determined by how many such rows or columns we can form with these 54 numbers.

5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Rows/Columns with Divisible Products**: Since 54 is not divisible evenly into 9 (the number of rows or columns in the grid), we cannot have all 9 rows or all 9 columns without a product divisible by 3. Therefore, at least one row and one column must have a product divisible by 3.

6. **Conclusion**: The least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is at least two (one row and one column). This is because with 54 numbers not divisible by 3, we cannot avoid having a product divisible by 3 in at least one row and one column.

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{2}$.

To solve this problem, we will follow a similar logical process to determine the minimum number of rows and columns with a product divisible by 3.

1. **Counting Numbers Divisible by 3**: In the range from 1 to 81:
   - There are \( \frac{81}{3} = 27 \) numbers that are divisible by 3.
   - Therefore, there are \( 81 - 27 = 54 \) numbers not divisible by 3.

2. **Understanding Divisibility and Arrangement**:
   - Each row and column in the grid must have at least one number.
   - To ensure that a product is divisible by 3, at least one of its factors must be divisible by 3.
   - Hence, to minimize products not divisible by 3, we need to maximize the distribution of numbers not divisible by 3.

3. **Maximizing Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - If each row and column has as many non-divisible-by-3 numbers as possible, they can be composed entirely of such numbers.
   - Given there are \(54\) numbers out of \(81\) that are not divisible by 3.

4. **Maximizing the Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - If we attempt to fill a row or column with non-divisible-by-3 numbers, each row can have up to \( \left\lfloor \frac{9}{2} \right\rfloor = 4 \) such numbers (as we cannot have more than half of any row be non-divisible by 3).

5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - With \(81\) total cells in a grid and each row/column having up to \(4\) non-divisible-by-3 numbers, we can have at most \( \left\lfloor \frac{81}{9} \right\rfloor = 9 \) rows or columns entirely composed of these non-divisible numbers.
   - Hence, the maximum number of non-divisible-by-3 cells (rows/columns) is \(9\).

6. **Ensuring at Least One Divisible by 3**:
   - Since each row and column must have at least one cell that contributes to a product divisible by 3:
   - If there are \(9\) rows or columns without products divisible by 3, we need at least \(1\) such row/column containing a number divisible by 3.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, with \(54\) non-divisible-by-3 numbers and each row/col having up to \(4\), the minimum number of rows and columns that will have products divisible by 3 is at least one.

Thus, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is \(\boxed{2}\).
Answer: To solve this problem, we will follow a similar logical process to determine the minimum number of rows and columns with a product divisible by 3.

1. **Counting Numbers Divisible by 3**: In the range from 1 to 81:
   - There are \( \frac{81}{3} = 27 \) numbers that are divisible by 3.
   - Therefore, there are \( 81 - 27 = 54 \) numbers not divisible by 3.

2. **Understanding Divisibility and Arrangement**:
   - Each row and column in the grid must have at least one number.
   - To ensure that a product is divisible by 3, at least one of its factors must be divisible by 3.
   - Hence, to minimize products not divisible by 3, we need to maximize the distribution of numbers not divisible by 3.

3. **Maximizing Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - If each row and column has as many non-divisible-by-3 numbers as possible, they can be composed entirely of such numbers.
   - Given there are \(54\) numbers out of \(81\) that are not divisible by 3.

4. **Maximizing the Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - If we attempt to fill a row or column with non-divisible-by-3 numbers, each row can have up to \( \left\lfloor \frac{9}{2} \right\rfloor = 4 \) such numbers (as we cannot have more than half of any row be non-divisible by 3).

5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**:
   - With \(81\) total cells in a grid and each row/column having up to \(4\) non-divisible-by-3 numbers, we can have at most \( \left\lfloor \frac{81}{9} \right\rfloor = 9 \) rows or columns entirely composed of these non-divisible numbers.
   - Hence, the maximum number of non-divisible-by-3 cells (rows/columns) is \(9\).

6. **Ensuring at Least One Divisible by 3**:
   - Since each row and column must have at least one cell that contributes to a product divisible by 3:
   - If there are \(9\) rows or columns without products divisible by 3, we need at least \(1\) such row/column containing a number divisible by 3.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, with \(54\) non-divisible-by-3 numbers and each row/col having up to \(4\), the minimum number of rows and columns that will have products divisible by 3 is at least one.

Thus, the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is \(\boxed{2}\). vs Expected: 11 | Accuracy: 0.0%


Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers. Three fifths of the pairs are red and the rest are white. Two thirds of the pairs are high-top and the rest are low-top. The red high-top sneakers make up a fraction of the collection. What is the least possible value of this fraction?

Using exemplars:
1. **Determine the number of red sneakers**: Since three fifths of Jordan's sneakers are red, we calculate this as:
   \[
   15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ pairs of red sneakers}.
   \]
2. **Calculate the remaining white sneakers**: The rest of the sneakers, which are white, would be:
   \[
   15 - 9 = 6 \text{ pairs of white sneakers}.
   \]
3. **Determine the number of high-top sneakers**: Since two thirds of Jordan's sneakers are high-top, we calculate this as:
   \[
   15 \times \frac{2}{3} = 10 \text{ pairs of high-top sneakers}.
   \]
4. **Calculate the remaining low-top sneakers**: The rest of the sneakers, which are low-top, would be:
   \[
   15 - 10 = 5 \text{ pairs of low-top sneakers}.
   \]
5. **Calculate the number of red high-top sneakers**: Assuming all red sneakers could be high-top, we calculate this as:
   \[
   \frac{9 \text{ pairs (red)}}{10 \text{ pairs (high-top)}} = 0.9 \text{ (fraction)}.
   \]
6. **Determine the fraction of red high-top sneakers in the total collection**: To find the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers out of all sneakers:
   \[
   \frac{0.9}{15} = 0.06 \text{ (fraction)}.
   \]
   
So, the least possible value of this fraction is $\boxed{0.06}$.

First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Total number of pairs of sneakers Jordan owns: 15.
- Three fifths are red.
- Two thirds are high-top.

Next, we calculate the number of each type of sneaker:

1. **Number of red sneakers**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Number of white sneakers**:
   \[
   15 - 9 = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Number of high-top sneakers**:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 15 = 10 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Number of low-top sneakers**:
   \[
   15 - 10 = 5 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Now, we need to determine the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers out of all sneakers.

To find this, we assume that all the red sneakers could be either high-top or low-top. Since there are more white sneakers (6 pairs) than any other type, having these as many high-top as possible would minimize the fraction of red high-top sneakers relative to total sneakers.

If we distribute 9 red sneakers between high-top and low-top, let's assume all 9 are low-top:
- Number of red low-top sneakers: 9
- Remaining high-top sneakers: \(10 - 9 = 1\)

Therefore, the number of high-top sneakers out of total sneakers is:
- High-top sneakers: 1 (red) + 10 (not red) = 11

The fraction of red high-top sneakers in the total collection would then be:
\[
\frac{9}{15} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

However, to find the least possible value of this fraction, we need to consider any distribution where more than one pair might be high-top. To minimize the fraction, assume all 6 white sneakers are low-top and distribute the remaining sneakers.

If we have:
- 9 red sneakers distributed (with some as high-top):
- Assume \(r\) red high-top sneakers.
- Then, total red sneakers = \(r + 10 - r = 9\).

Thus, if we assume only one pair of red high-top sneakers and all others low-top:
- Number of high-top sneakers: 1 (red) + 9 (not red) = 10
- Total number of sneakers: 15

The fraction of red high-top sneakers is then:
\[
\frac{1}{15}
\]

To confirm that this is the least possible, let's check if more than one pair can be red and high-top. If we assume two pairs are red and high-top, it would still yield a fraction greater than \(\frac{1}{15}\).

Thus, the least possible value of the fraction is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{15}}
\]
Answer: First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

4. **Number of low-top sneakers**:

Now, we need to determine the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers out of all sneakers.

To find this, we assume that all the red sneakers could be either high-top or low-top. Since there are more white sneakers (6 pairs) than any other type, having these as many high-top as possible would minimize the fraction of red high-top sneakers relative to total sneakers.

If we distribute 9 red sneakers between high-top and low-top, let's assume all 9 are low-top:
- Number of red low-top sneakers: 9
- Remaining high-top sneakers: \(10 - 9 = 1\)

Therefore, the number of high-top sneakers out of total sneakers is:
- High-top sneakers: 1 (red) + 10 (not red) = 11

The fraction of red high-top sneakers in the total collection would then be:
\[
\frac{9}{15} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

However, to find the least possible value of this fraction, we need to consider any distribution where more than one pair might be high-top. To minimize the fraction, assume all 6 white sneakers are low-top and distribute the remaining sneakers.

If we have:
- 9 red sneakers distributed (with some as high-top):
- Assume \(r\) red high-top sneakers.
- Then, total red sneakers = \(r + 10 - r = 9\).

Thus, if we assume only one pair of red high-top sneakers and all others low-top:
- Number of high-top sneakers: 1 (red) + 9 (not red) = 10
- Total number of sneakers: 15

The fraction of red high-top sneakers is then:
\[
\frac{1}{15}
\]

To confirm that this is the least possible, let's check if more than one pair can be red and high-top. If we assume two pairs are red and high-top, it would still yield a fraction greater than \(\frac{1}{15}\).

Thus, the least possible value of the fraction is:

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: A group of frogs (called an army) is living in a tree. A frog turns green when in the shade and turns yellow when in the sun. Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. Now the ratio is 4:1. What is the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the initial number of green frogs as G and the initial number of yellow frogs as Y. According to the problem, the initial ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1, which can be written as:
   G/Y = 3/1 or G = 3Y

2. Then, 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. After this movement, the ratio of green to yellow frogs became 4:1. This can be written as:
   (G - 3) / (Y + 5) = 4/1 or G - 3 = 4(Y + 5)

3. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by substitution. Substitute the first equation (G = 3Y) into the second equation:
   3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5)

4. Solve for Y:
   3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20
   -3 - 20 = 4Y - 3Y
   -23 = Y

5. Now that we have the value of Y, we can find the value of G using the first equation (G = 3Y):
   G = 3 * (-23) = -69. But since the number of frogs cannot be negative, there must be a mistake in the problem or our understanding of it. The numbers given in the problem do not lead to a valid solution.

However, if we assume that the initial ratio was 3:1 and 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side (making the ratio 2:1), while 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side, then we get a valid solution:

G = 9 * 3 = 27 (initial number of green frogs)
Y = 3 * 3 = 9 (initial number of yellow frogs)
G - 3 = 24 (number of green frogs after movement)
Y + 5 = 14 (number of yellow frogs after movement)
The ratio is now 2:1, which matches the problem's statement.

So, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is:
   $$ \boxed{24 - 14 = 10} $$

To solve this problem, we will use a similar approach as the example solution.

Let's denote:
- \( G \) as the initial number of green frogs.
- \( Y \) as the initial number of yellow frogs.

From the given information, we know that initially the ratio of green to yellow frogs is 3:1. This can be expressed as:
\[ G/Y = 3/1 \]
This implies:
\[ G = 3Y \]

Next, we are told that 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. The new ratio of green to yellow frogs is now 4:1. This can be expressed as:
\[ (G - 3)/(Y + 5) = 4/1 \]
This implies:
\[ G - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]

We already know from the initial condition that \( G = 3Y \). We substitute this into the new ratio equation:
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]

Now we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]
Subtract \( 4Y \) from both sides:
\[ 3Y - 4Y - 3 = 20 \]
Simplify:
\[ -Y - 3 = 20 \]
Add 3 to both sides:
\[ -Y = 23 \]
Multiply by -1:
\[ Y = -23 \]

Since the number of frogs cannot be negative, we need to re-examine our initial assumptions. Let's reconsider the problem with a different interpretation.

If initially there are \( G \) green frogs and \( Y \) yellow frogs such that their ratio is 3:1, then:
\[ G = 3Y \]

After moving:
- The number of green frogs becomes \( G - 3 \).
- The number of yellow frogs becomes \( Y + 5 \).

The new ratio is given as 4:1. Therefore:
\[ (G - 3)/(Y + 5) = 4/1 \]
This implies:
\[ G - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]

Substitute \( G = 3Y \):
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5) \]
Simplify and solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20 \]
Subtract \( 4Y \) from both sides:
\[ -Y - 3 = 20 \]
Add 3 to both sides:
\[ -Y = 23 \]
Multiply by -1:
\[ Y = -23 \]

Again, the negative result indicates a mistake. Let's re-evaluate:

Given \( G = 3Y \), let’s assume different numbers that fit our initial and final ratios.

If initially there are 9 green frogs (since they were 3 parts of 3:1):
\[ G = 9 \]
Then:
\[ Y = 3 \]

After moving:
- Green frogs become \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)
- Yellow frogs become \( 3 + 5 = 8 \)

The new ratio is:
\[ 6/8 = 3/4 \neq 4/1 \]

Thus, we need to find a valid solution where the ratios match. Let’s assume initial values for different conditions:

If initially there are 27 green frogs (since they were 9 parts of 3:1):
\[ G = 27 \]
Then:
\[ Y = 9 \]

After moving:
- Green frogs become \( 27 - 3 = 24 \)
- Yellow frogs become \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)

The new ratio is:
\[ 24/14 = 12/7 \neq 4/1 \]

We need to find a valid pair that satisfies the conditions. Let's assume different initial values:

If initially there are 30 green frogs (since they were 9 parts of 3:1):
\[ G = 30 \]
Then:
\[ Y = 10 \]

After moving:
- Green frogs become \( 30 - 3 = 27 \)
- Yellow frogs become \( 10 + 5 = 15 \)

The new ratio is:
\[ 27/15 = 9/5 \neq 4/1 \]

Finally, assuming different initial values leads us to find the correct solution:

Assume initially there are 24 green frogs (since they were 8 parts of 3:1):
\[ G = 24 \]
Then:
\[ Y = 8 \]

After moving:
- Green frogs become \( 24 - 3 = 21 \)
- Yellow frogs become \( 8 + 5 = 13 \)

The new ratio is:
\[ 21/13 = 7/6.5 \neq 4/1 \]

Thus, the correct initial values are found to be:

Initial values: 
\[ G = 27, Y = 9 \]
After moving:
- Green frogs become \( 27 - 3 = 24 \)
- Yellow frogs become \( 9 + 5 = 14 \)

The difference between the number of green and yellow frogs now is:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: A small airplane has 4 rows of seats with 3 seats in each row. Eight passengers have boarded the plane and are distributed randomly among the seats. A married couple is next to board. What is the probability there will be 2 adjacent seats in the same row for the couple?

Using exemplars:
1. There are a total of $4 \times 3 = 12$ seats on the plane.
2. The number of ways to choose 2 adjacent seats in the same row is $4 \times 3 = 12$. This is because there are 4 rows and each row has 3 seats, and any pair of adjacent seats will be counted once per row.
3. The total number of ways to choose any 2 seats for the couple is $\binom{10}{2} = 45$. This is because after seating 8 passengers randomly, there are 10 remaining seats.
4. Therefore, the probability that the couple will sit in adjacent seats in the same row is $12/45$.

The final answer is $\boxed{12/45}$.

Let's break down the problem into steps, similar to the example provided.

### Step 1: Total number of ways to choose any 2 seats out of 10

The airplane has a total of $4 \times 3 = 12$ seats arranged in a grid. When 8 passengers have already boarded randomly, there are $10$ remaining seats for the couple to sit.

We use the combination formula $\binom{n}{k}$ which represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$ items without regard to order.
\[
\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
\]

### Step 2: Number of ways the couple can sit in adjacent seats

Now, we consider how many pairs of adjacent seats are available within each row. Each row has 3 seats, and there are $4$ rows, leading to:
- Adjacent pairings for 1st seat (in any row): 2 (e.g., (1,2) or (2,3))
- Adjacent pairings for 2nd seat: 2 (e.g., (1,2), (2,3))

For the other seats in a row:
- For the middle seat of each row: Adjacent pairs are possible only to adjacent rows.
- Thus, we must count pairs within one row separately:

Each row can have up to $4$ sets of adjacent seats. Hence for 4 rows:
\[
12 \text{ (pairs per row)} \times 4 \text{ rows} = 12
\]

### Step 3: Probability calculation

The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes (adjacent pairs) to the total number of possible pairs.

Total ways to choose any 2 seats out of 10:
\[
\binom{10}{2} = 45
\]

Number of adjacent seat pairings for the couple:
\[
12
\]

Thus, the probability that the couple will sit in an adjacent pair is given by:
\[
P(\text{adjacent seats}) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{total number of possible pairs}} = \frac{12}{45}
\]

### Final Answer
$$ \boxed{\frac{12}{45}} $$

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.
2. In our expression, we have no parentheses or exponents, so we can move on to multiplication and division. We have two multiplications: 8 * 4 and 4 * 2.
3. Perform the first multiplication: 8 * 4 = 32.
4. Replace the first multiplication in the expression with its result: (32 + 2) - (8 + 4 * 2).
5. Now, perform the remaining multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8.
6. Replace the second multiplication in the expression with its result: (32 + 2) - (8 + 8).
7. Next, we do addition and subtraction from left to right. First, add 2 to 32: 32 + 2 = 34.
8. Replace the first addition in the expression with its result: 34 - (8 + 8).
9. Now, add 8 to 8 inside the parentheses: 8 + 8 = 16.
10. Replace the second addition in the expression with its result: 34 - 16.
11. Finally, subtract 16 from 34: 34 - 16 = 18.
12. The final answer is $\boxed{18}$.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: Wind chill is a measure of how cold people feel when exposed to wind outside. A good estimate for wind chill can be found using this calculation (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed) where temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed is measured in miles per hour (mph). Suppose the air temperature is 36 degrees F and the wind speed is 18 mph. Which of the following is closest to the approximate wind chill?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to calculate the wind chill using the given formula: (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed)
2. Substitute the given values into the formula: (wind chill) = 36 - 0.7 * 18
3. Multiply the wind speed by 0.7: 0.7 * 18 = 12.6
4. Subtract this value from the air temperature: 36 - 12.6 = 23.4
5. Therefore, the approximate wind chill is closest to $$23$$

Sure, let's follow the steps you've outlined:

1. **Calculate Wind Chill Using the Formula:** 
   \[
   (wind\ chill) = (air\ temperature) - 0.7 * (wind\ speed)
   \]
2. **Substitute Given Values:**
   Air Temperature = 36 degrees F
   Wind Speed = 18 mph
   
   So, we have:
   \[
   (wind\ chill) = 36 - 0.7 * 18
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication First:**
   \[
   0.7 * 18 = 12.6
   \]
   
4. **Subtract the Result from the Temperature:**
   \[
   (wind\ chill) = 36 - 12.6 = 23.4
   \]

Therefore, the approximate wind chill is closest to \(23\).

So, the final answer is:
$$ 23 $$

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: A lake contains 250 trout, along with a variety of other fish. When a marine biologist catches and releases a sample of 180 fish from the lake, 30 are identified as trout. Assume that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. How many fish are there in the lake?

Using exemplars:
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. This means that the ratio of trout to total fish in the sample (30 trout out of 180 fish) should be equal to the ratio of trout to total fish in the lake (250 trout out of x total fish).

2. We can set up a proportion to represent this relationship:
   \[ \frac{30}{180} = \frac{250}{x} \]

3. To solve for x, we cross-multiply:
   \[ 30 * x = 180 * 250 \]

4. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 30x = 45000 \]

5. Divide both sides by 30 to solve for x:
   \[ x = \frac{45000}{30} = 1500 \]

6. Therefore, the lake contains 1500 fish in total.

The final answer is $\boxed{1500}$.

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Harold made a plum pie to take on a picnic. He was able to eat only 1/4 of the pie, and he left the rest for his friends. A moose came by and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. After that, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. How much of the original pie still remained after the porcupine left?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's determine how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate only 1/4 of it, he left 3/4 of the pie for his friends.
2. Next, the moose came along and ate 1/3 of what was left. So, the moose ate 1/3 * (3/4) = 1/4 of the original pie.
3. After the moose, there was still 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 or 1/2 of the pie left.
4. Then, the porcupine came and ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. So, the porcupine ate 1/3 * (1/2) = 1/6 of the original pie.
5. Finally, to find out how much pie was left after the porcupine, we subtract the amount it ate from what was left after the moose: 1/2 - 1/6.
6. To calculate this, we first need a common denominator, which in this case is 6. So, we have (3/6) - (1/6) = 2/6.
7. Simplifying this fraction gives us the final answer: $$ \boxed{2/6} $$.

Model response:
qwen2.5:3b progress:  90%|███████████████████▊  | 18/20 [04:01<00:21, 10.88s/it]
Let's break down the problem step-by-step as we did with the previous example.

1. Harold ate 1/4 of the pie, so he left 3/4 of the pie for his friends.
2. The moose then came and ate 1/3 of what was left after Harold. So it ate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( \frac{3}{4} \):
   \[
   \text{Amount eaten by the moose} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]
3. Therefore, after the moose ate, the amount of pie left is:
   \[
   \text{Pie left} = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
4. Next, a porcupine came and ate 1/3 of what was left after the moose:
   \[
   \text{Amount eaten by the porcupine} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]
5. Thus, after the porcupine ate, the remaining amount of pie is:
   \[
   \text{Pie left} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6}
   \]

Now we need to subtract these fractions. To do this, we use a common denominator, which in this case is 6:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}, \quad \text{so: } \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6}
\]

Simplifying this fraction gives us:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
$$ \boxed{\frac{1}{3}} $$

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: NASA's Perseverance Rover was launched on July 30 2020 After traveling 292,526,838 miles, it landed on Mars in Jezero Crater about 6.5 months later. Which of the following is closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour?

Using exemplars:
1. The total distance traveled by NASA's Perseverance Rover is 292,526,838 miles.
2. The time taken to travel this distance is 6.5 months, which is equivalent to 6.5 * 30 = 195 days. We convert this into hours because we want the speed in miles per hour. So, 195 days * 24 hours/day = 4680 hours.
3. Now, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, the average speed is 292,526,838 miles / 4680 hours = 62,500 miles/hour approximately.

Therefore, the closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour is $\boxed{62,500}$ mph.

To determine the average speed of NASA's Perseverance Rover, we need to calculate its speed using the given information: the total distance traveled is 292,526,838 miles, and the time taken is approximately 6.5 months.

First, convert the time from months to days:
\[ 6.5 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 195 \text{ days} \]

Next, convert the total travel time (in days) into hours since we need speed in miles per hour:
\[ 195 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 4680 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total travel time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{292,526,838 \text{ miles}}{4680 \text{ hours}} \]

Perform the division to get the speed in miles per hour:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = 62,500.017 \text{ mph} \]

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps, with exactly 20 of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's determine the total value of all the stamps Nicolas has. He has 20 stamps each of 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents. So, the total value is:
   (20 * 5) + (20 * 10) + (20 * 25) = $100

2. Now, we want to maximize the number of stamps Nicolas can use for exactly $7.10. Since he has a large number of stamps and the total value is $100, it's likely that he will need to use some 25-cent stamps to reach this amount.

3. Let's start by calculating how many 25-cent stamps Nicolas can use without exceeding $7.10. This would be:
   $7.10 / $0.25 = 28 with a remainder of $0.30

4. Since we have a remainder, it means that we need to add some smaller value stamps (either 5-cent or 10-cent) to reach exactly $7.10. The remaining amount is $0.30.

5. If Nicolas uses all the 25-cent stamps and still needs more, he can use either 5-cent or 10-cent stamps. But since he has fewer 5-cent stamps than 10-cent stamps, it would be more efficient to use 10-cent stamps.

6. So, let's see how many 10-cent stamps Nicolas can use with the remaining $0.30. This would be:
   $0.30 / $0.10 = 3 stamps with no remainder

7. Therefore, Nicolas can use 28 twenty-five-cent stamps and 3 ten-cent stamps to make exactly $7.10 in postage.

To determine the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use to cover $7.10, let's start by calculating the total value of his stamp collection.

Nicolas has 20 stamps each of 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents:
- Total value from 5-cent stamps: \( 20 \times 5 = \$1.00 \)
- Total value from 10-cent stamps: \( 20 \times 10 = \$2.00 \)
- Total value from 25-cent stamps: \( 20 \times 25 = \$50.00 \)

Adding these values together, the total value of all his stamps is:
\[ \$1.00 + \$2.00 + \$50.00 = \$53.00 \]

Now we want to maximize the number of stamps while ensuring the postage amount remains $7.10.

We start by considering how many 25-cent stamps Nicolas can use, as they are worth the most:
\[ 7.10 / 0.25 = 28 \text{ with a remainder} \]
So, he can use 28 twenty-five cent stamps and calculate the remaining amount:

The value from 28 twenty-five cent stamps is \( 28 \times 0.25 = \$7.00 \).

With $7.10 remaining:
\[ \$7.10 - \$7.00 = \$0.10 \]

Now, to cover the remaining $0.10 with 5-cent and 10-cent stamps:

Since \( 0.10 < 0.25 \), we can't use any more 25-cent stamps.

- Using one ten cent stamp gives us \( \$1.00 - \$0.10 = \$0.90 \).
- We need an additional $0.10, which is covered by using one five cent stamp.

Thus, Nicolas uses:
- 28 twenty-five cent stamps
- One ten-cent stamp
- One five-cent stamp

Adding these up gives us the total number of stamps:
\[ 28 + 1 + 1 = 30 \]

Therefore, the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage is \( \boxed{30} \).
Answer: To determine the maximum number of stamps Nicolas can use to cover $7.10, let's start by calculating the total value of his stamp collection.

With $7.10 remaining:

Now, to cover the remaining $0.10 with 5-cent and 10-cent stamps:

Since \( 0.10 < 0.25 \), we can't use any more 25-cent stamps.

- Using one ten cent stamp gives us \( \$1.00 - \$0.10 = \$0.90 \).
- We need an additional $0.10, which is covered by using one five cent stamp.

Thus, Nicolas uses:
- 28 twenty-five cent stamps
- One ten-cent stamp
- One five-cent stamp

The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given to be 90. So, we can set up the following equation: \n\\[ x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90 \\]\n5.
