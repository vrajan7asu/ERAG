Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: What is the value of this expression in decimal form? 44/11 + 110/44 + 44/1100

Using exemplars:
1. First, we simplify each fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each pair of numbers in the numerator and denominator.
   - GCD(44, 11) = 11, so 44/11 becomes 4/1.
   - GCD(110, 44) = 22, so 110/44 becomes 5/2.
   - GCD(44, 1100) = 44, so 44/1100 becomes 1/25.

2. Now we have the simplified fractions: 4/1 + 5/2 + 1/25.

3. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1, 2, and 25 is 50. So we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
   - 4/1 becomes 200/50.
   - 5/2 becomes 125/50.
   - 1/25 becomes 2/50.

4. Finally, we add these fractions together: 200/50 + 125/50 + 2/50 = 327/50.

5. To convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 327 ÷ 50 = 6.54.

So, the value of the expression in decimal form is \boxed{6.54}.

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: When Yunji added all the integers from 1 to 9, she mistakenly left out a number. Her incorrect sum turned out to be a square number. What number did Yunji leave out?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 9. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. In this case, n=9.
   Sum = 9*(9+1)/2 = 45

2. Next, we need to find a square number that could be the result of an incorrect sum due to one number being left out. Since the numbers from 1 to 9 add up to 45, leaving out one number would mean the incorrect sum is one less than 45, which is 44.

3. However, 44 is not a square number. We need to find the smallest square number greater than 44 that could be a possible incorrect sum. The next square number after 44 is 49 (7^2). So, Yunji might have left out two numbers instead of one.

4. If Yunji left out two numbers from the sequence, we need to find which two numbers she could have left out such that their sum is equal to 45 minus the square number 49. In other words, we need to find two numbers x and y such that x + y = 45 - 49 = -4.

5. The only pair of integers between 1 and 9 whose sum equals -4 is (3, -7). However, since we are considering positive integers from 1 to 9, the number that Yunji left out should be negative in this context. But we know that there's no negative integer from 1 to 9.

6. Therefore, our assumption of leaving out two numbers is incorrect. Let's go back and check for one number being left out. Since 45 is not a square number, let's find the next possible square number greater than 45. The next square number after 45 is 64 (8^2).

7. Now we need to find which single number was left out such that the sum of the remaining numbers equals 64. In other words, we need to find a number x such that 45 - x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = -19, which is not within our range of integers from 1 to 9.

8. Therefore, there's no single integer from 1 to 9 that Yunji could have left out to result in a square number when summing the remaining integers. However, if we consider leaving out two numbers again, then we can find a solution:

- If Yunji left out both 4 and 5, the sum of the remaining numbers would be 45 - (4 + 5) = 36, which is a square number (6^2).

Final answer: $$ \boxed{4} $$ and $$ \boxed{5} $$, as leaving out both these numbers results in an incorrect sum that is a square number.

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: Aaliyah rolls two standard 6-sided dice. She notices that the product of the two numbers rolled is a multiple of 6. Which of the following integers cannot be the sum of the two numbers?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's consider the possible outcomes when rolling two standard 6-sided dice that would result in a product being a multiple of

6. The pairs of rolls that give a product divisible by 6 are: (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,2), (3,6), (4,3), (4,6), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and (6,6).

2. Now, let's calculate the sum of each pair: 7, 5, 8, 5, 9, 7, 10, 7, 9, 11, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.

3. From these sums, we can see that all integers from 5 to 12 are possible sums of the two numbers rolled, except for 4.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{4} $$ cannot be the sum of the two numbers Aaliyah rolled if their product is a multiple of 6.

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: On Monday, Taye has $2. Every day, he either gains $3 or doubles the amount of money he had on the previous day. How many different dollar amounts could Taye have on Thursday, 3 days later?

Using exemplars:
1. On Monday, Taye has $2.
2. On Tuesday, he can either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Monday. So, the possible amounts he could have are $2 + $3 = $5 or $2 * 2 = $4.
3. On Wednesday, he can again either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Tuesday. So, for each amount he had on Tuesday ($5 or $4), the possible amounts he could have on Wednesday are $5 + $3 = $8 or $5 * 2 = $10 and $4 + $3 = $7 or $4 * 2 = $8.
4. On Thursday, he can again either gain $3 or double the amount of money he had on Wednesday. So, for each amount he had on Wednesday ($8, $10, $7, or $8), the possible amounts he could have on Thursday are $8 + $3 = $11, $8 * 2 = $16, $10 + $3 = $13, $10 * 2 = $20, $7 + $3 = $10, $7 * 2 = $14, and again $8 + $3 = $11.
5. Therefore, the possible amounts of money Taye could have on Thursday are $11, $16, $13, $20, $10, and $14.

The final answer is that there are 6 different dollar amounts Taye could have on Thursday: $$ \boxed{11}, \boxed{16}, \boxed{13}, \boxed{20}, \boxed{10}, \boxed{14} $$.

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: All the marbles in Maria's collection are red, green, or blue. Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles, and twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Which of the following could be the total number of marbles in Maria's collection?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of green marbles as G.
2. According to the problem, Maria has half as many red marbles as green marbles. So, the number of red marbles is (G/2).
3. The problem also states that Maria has twice as many blue marbles as green marbles. Therefore, the number of blue marbles is 2G.
4. To find the total number of marbles, we add up the number of red, green, and blue marbles: (G/2) + G + 2G = (5/2) * G.
5. Since the total number of marbles must be a whole number, G must be a multiple of 2. Let's try different multiples of 2 for G and see if the total number of marbles is a whole number.
6. If G = 2, then the total number of marbles is (5/2) * 2 = 5. This is a possible answer because 5 is a whole number.

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: In January 1980 the Mauna Loa Observatory recorded carbon dioxide (CO2) levels of 338 ppm (parts per million). Over the years the average (CO2) reading has increased by about 1.515 ppm each year. What is the expected CO2 level in ppm in January 2030? Round your answer to the nearest integer.

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find out how many years have passed since January 1980 until January 2030. That's 50 years.
2. Next, we calculate the total increase in CO2 levels over these 50 years by multiplying the yearly increase (1.515 ppm) by the number of years (50). So, $1.515 \times 50 = 75.75$ ppm.
3. Finally, we add this total increase to the initial CO2 level in January 1980 (338 ppm) to find the expected CO2 level in January 2030. So, $338 + 75.75 = 413.75$ ppm.

The expected CO2 level in January 2030 is approximately $$ \boxed{414} $$ parts per million.

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: The coordinates of triangle ABC are A(5,7), B(11,7), and C(3,y), with y > 7. The area of triangle ABC is 12. What is the value of y?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find the height of the triangle using point B as the base. Since points A and B have the same y-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference in their x-coordinates. So, the length of AB (the base) is |5 - 11| = 6 units.

2. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2. We know that the area is 12 and the base is 6, so we can set up an equation to solve for the height: 12 = (6 * h) / 2 => h = 4 units.

3. Since the height of the triangle is perpendicular to the base, we can use it as a reference to find the y-coordinate of point C. The difference between the y-coordinates of points B and C is equal to the height of the triangle. So, y = 7 + h (where h is the height) = 7 + 4 = \boxed{11}.

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: Rohan keeps a total of 90 guppies in 4 fish tanks. There is 1 more guppy in the 2nd tank than in the 1st tank. There are 2 more guppies in the 3rd tank than in the 2nd tank. There are 3 more guppies in the 4th tank than in the 3rd tank. How many guppies are in the 4th tank?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the number of guppies in the first tank as $x$. According to the problem, there is 1 more guppy in the second tank than in the first, so we can denote the number of guppies in the second tank as $(x + 1)$.
2. Similarly, there are 2 more guppies in the third tank than in the second, so we can denote the number of guppies in the third tank as $((x + 1) + 2 = x + 3)$.
3. And finally, there are 3 more guppies in the fourth tank than in the third, so we can denote the number of guppies in the fourth tank as $((x + 3) + 3 = x + 6)$.
4. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given to be 90. So, we can set up the following equation: $x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90$.
5. Solving this equation gives us $4x + 10 = 90$, which simplifies to $4x = 80$. So, $x = 20$.
6. Substituting $x = 20$ into our expression for the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we get $20 + 6 = \boxed{26}$ guppies.

4. The total number of guppies in all four tanks is given to be 90. So, we can set up the following equation: $x + (x + 1) + (x + 3) + (x + 6) = 90$.
5. Solving this equation gives us $4x + 10 = 90$, which simplifies to $4x = 80$. So, $x = 20$.
6. Substituting $x = 20$ into our expression for the number of guppies in the fourth tank, we get $20 + 6 = \boxed{26}$ guppies. vs Expected: 26 | Accuracy: 11.1%


Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Let the letters F, L, Y, B, U, G represent distinct digits. Suppose F L Y F L Y is the greatest number that satisfies the equation FLYFLY = BUGBUG. What is the value of FLY + BUG?

Using exemplars:
1. We know that F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G, which means both sides are six-digit numbers.
2. Since the left side has two F's, one L, and one Y, it suggests that BUGBUG should also have the same pattern but with different digits to ensure distinctness. This leads us to the conclusion that the right side must be a multiple of 10101 (since multiplying any number by 10101 shifts its digits two places to the left and appends them again on the right).
3. The largest six-digit multiple of 10101 is 99999 * 10101 = 999990001.
4. From this, we find that F = 9, L = 9, Y = 0, B = 8, U = 9, and G = 0. However, since the digits must be distinct, this solution doesn't work because both 9 and 0 are repeated.
5. So, we need to find the next largest multiple of 10101, which is 99989 * 10101 = 999890001.
6. Now, F = 9, L = 9, Y = 0, B = 8, U = 7, and G = 1. This solution satisfies the distinctness condition.
7. Therefore, FLY + BUG = 900 + 871 = 1771.

1. From the problem statement, we know that $F L Y F L Y = B U G B U G$, where both sides represent six-digit numbers.
2. Since the left side has two F's, one L, and one Y, it suggests that the pattern on the right side must have the same number of each digit but with different values to ensure they are distinct.
3. This implies that the right side (BUGBUG) is a multiple of 10101 since multiplying any number by 10101 shifts its digits two places to the left and appends them again on the right.
4. The largest six-digit multiple of 10101 is $99999 \times 10101 = 999990001$. However, using 9's and 0's violates the distinct digits condition as both numbers would contain repeated digits.
5. Therefore, we need to find the next largest multiple of 10101 that meets the criteria. That number is $99989 \times 10101 = 999890001$.
6. From this arrangement, it follows that:
   - $F = 9$
   - $L = 9$ (but we need distinct digits)
   - $Y = 0$
   - $B = 8$
   - $U = 7$
   - $G = 1$
7. However, since L is repeated and must be distinct, this configuration does not work. We need another approach. The next multiple of 10101 that maintains digit uniqueness is $99988 \times 10101 = 999880001$.
8. Now:
   - $F = 9$
   - $L = 7$
   - $Y = 0$
   - $B = 8$
   - $U = 6$
   - $G = 2$
9. With these digits, the equation FLYFLY = BUGBUG becomes $970970 = 862862$.
10. Summing these two numbers gives us: $970 + 970 + 862 + 862 = 3464$.

Thus, the value of $FLY + BUG$ is $$ \boxed{3464} $$.

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: Minh enters the numbers 1 through 81 into the cells of a 9x9 grid in some order. She calculates the product of the numbers in each row and column. What is the least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding Divisibility by 3**: A product is divisible by 3 if at least one of the factors in the product is divisible by 3. In the range of numbers from 1 to 81, there are 27 numbers that are divisible by 3 (since every third number in this sequence is divisible by 3).

2. **Minimum Requirement for Divisibility**: To ensure a product is divisible by 3, at least one number in the set of factors must be divisible by 3. This means that each row and column can contribute at least one number divisible by 3 to the product.

3. **Maximizing Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: If we want to minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3, we should maximize the number of rows and columns without any number divisible by 3. This would mean having rows or columns composed entirely of numbers not divisible by 3.

4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: There are 54 numbers from 1 to 81 that are not divisible by 3 (since there are 27 numbers divisible by 3). If we arrange these 54 numbers in rows and columns without any number divisible by 3, the maximum number of rows or columns we can have without a product divisible by 3 is determined by how many such rows or columns we can form with these 54 numbers.

5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Rows/Columns with Divisible Products**: Since 54 is not divisible evenly into 9 (the number of rows or columns in the grid), we cannot have all 9 rows or all 9 columns without a product divisible by 3. Therefore, at least one row and one column must have a product divisible by 3.

6. **Conclusion**: The least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is at least two (one row and one column). This is because with 54 numbers not divisible by 3, we cannot avoid having a product divisible by 3 in at least one row and one column.

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Jordan owns 15 pairs of sneakers. Three fifths of the pairs are red and the rest are white. Two thirds of the pairs are high-top and the rest are low-top. The red high-top sneakers make up a fraction of the collection. What is the least possible value of this fraction?

Using exemplars:
1. **Determine the number of red sneakers**: Since three fifths of Jordan's sneakers are red, we calculate this as:
   \[
   15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ pairs of red sneakers}.
   \]
2. **Calculate the remaining white sneakers**: The rest of the sneakers, which are white, would be:

   \]
4. **Calculate the remaining low-top sneakers**: The rest of the sneakers, which are low-top, would be:
   \[
   15 - 10 = 5 \text{ pairs of low-top sneakers}.
   \]
5. **Calculate the number of red high-top sneakers**: Assuming all red sneakers could be high-top, we calculate this as:
   \[
   \frac{9 \text{ pairs (red)}}{10 \text{ pairs (high-top)}} = 0.9 \text{ (fraction)}.
   \]
6. **Determine the fraction of red high-top sneakers in the total collection**: To find the least possible fraction of red high-top sneakers out of all sneakers:
   \[
   \frac{0.9}{15} = 0.06 \text{ (fraction)}.
   \]
   
So, the least possible value of this fraction is $\boxed{0.06}$.

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: A group of frogs (called an army) is living in a tree. A frog turns green when in the shade and turns yellow when in the sun. Initially, the ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1. Then 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. Now the ratio is 4:1. What is the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the initial number of green frogs as G and the initial number of yellow frogs as Y. According to the problem, the initial ratio of green to yellow frogs was 3:1, which can be written as:
   G/Y = 3/1 or G = 3Y

2. Then, 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side and 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side. After this movement, the ratio of green to yellow frogs became 4:1. This can be written as:
   (G - 3) / (Y + 5) = 4/1 or G - 3 = 4(Y + 5)

3. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by substitution. Substitute the first equation (G = 3Y) into the second equation:
   3Y - 3 = 4(Y + 5)

4. Solve for Y:
   3Y - 3 = 4Y + 20
   -3 - 20 = 4Y - 3Y
   -23 = Y

5. Now that we have the value of Y, we can find the value of G using the first equation (G = 3Y):
   G = 3 * (-23) = -69. But since the number of frogs cannot be negative, there must be a mistake in the problem or our understanding of it. The numbers given in the problem do not lead to a valid solution.

However, if we assume that the initial ratio was 3:1 and 3 green frogs moved to the sunny side (making the ratio 2:1), while 5 yellow frogs moved to the shady side, then we get a valid solution:

G = 9 * 3 = 27 (initial number of green frogs)
Y = 3 * 3 = 9 (initial number of yellow frogs)
G - 3 = 24 (number of green frogs after movement)
Y + 5 = 14 (number of yellow frogs after movement)
The ratio is now 2:1, which matches the problem's statement.

So, the difference between the number of green frogs and the number of yellow frogs now is:
   $$ \boxed{24 - 14 = 10} $$

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: A small airplane has 4 rows of seats with 3 seats in each row. Eight passengers have boarded the plane and are distributed randomly among the seats. A married couple is next to board. What is the probability there will be 2 adjacent seats in the same row for the couple?

Using exemplars:
1. There are a total of $4 \times 3 = 12$ seats on the plane.
2. The number of ways to choose 2 adjacent seats in the same row is $4 \times 3 = 12$. This is because there are 4 rows and each row has 3 seats, and any pair of adjacent seats will be counted once per row.
3. The total number of ways to choose any 2 seats for the couple is $\binom{10}{2} = 45$. This is because after seating 8 passengers randomly, there are 10 remaining seats.
4. Therefore, the probability that the couple will sit in adjacent seats in the same row is $12/45$.

2. Next, we calculate the number of ways the couple can sit in adjacent seats in the same row. There are 4 rows and each row has 3 seats, so there are $4 \times 2 = 8$ pairs of adjacent seats in the same row (since each pair is counted twice per row).

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: Wind chill is a measure of how cold people feel when exposed to wind outside. A good estimate for wind chill can be found using this calculation (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed) where temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and the wind speed is measured in miles per hour (mph). Suppose the air temperature is 36 degrees F and the wind speed is 18 mph. Which of the following is closest to the approximate wind chill?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to calculate the wind chill using the given formula: (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed)
2. Substitute the given values into the formula: (wind chill) = 36 - 0.7 * 18
3. Multiply the wind speed by 0.7: 0.7 * 18 = 12.6
4. Subtract this value from the air temperature: 36 - 12.6 = 23.4
5. Therefore, the approximate wind chill is closest to $$23$$

1. We start with the given formula for calculating the wind chill: (wind chill) = (air temperature) - 0.7 * (wind speed)
2. Substitute the given values into the formula: (wind chill) = 36 - 0.7 * 18
3. Multiply the wind speed by 0.7: 0.7 * 18 = 12.6
4. Subtract this value from the air temperature: 36 - 12.6 = 23.4
5. Therefore, the approximate wind chill is closest to $$23$$

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: A lake contains 250 trout, along with a variety of other fish. When a marine biologist catches and releases a sample of 180 fish from the lake, 30 are identified as trout. Assume that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. How many fish are there in the lake?

Using exemplars:
1. The problem states that the ratio of trout to the total number of fish is the same in both the sample and the lake. This means that the ratio of trout to total fish in the sample (30 trout out of 180 fish) should be equal to the ratio of trout to total fish in the lake (250 trout out of x total fish).

2. We can set up a proportion to represent this relationship:
   \[ \frac{30}{180} = \frac{250}{x} \]

3. To solve for x, we cross-multiply:
   \[ 30 * x = 180 * 250 \]

4. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 30x = 45000 \]

5. Divide both sides by 30 to solve for x:
   \[ x = \frac{45000}{30} = 1500 \]

6. Therefore, the lake contains 1500 fish in total.

The final answer is $\boxed{1500}$.

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Harold made a plum pie to take on a picnic. He was able to eat only 1/4 of the pie, and he left the rest for his friends. A moose came by and ate 1/3 of what Harold left behind. After that, a porcupine ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. How much of the original pie still remained after the porcupine left?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's determine how much of the pie Harold left for his friends. Since he ate only 1/4 of it, he left 3/4 of the pie for his friends.
2. Next, the moose came along and ate 1/3 of what was left. So, the moose ate 1/3 * (3/4) = 1/4 of the original pie.
3. After the moose, there was still 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 or 1/2 of the pie left.
4. Then, the porcupine came and ate 1/3 of what the moose left behind. So, the porcupine ate 1/3 * (1/2) = 1/6 of the original pie.
5. Finally, to find out how much pie was left after the porcupine, we subtract the amount it ate from what was left after the moose: 1/2 - 1/6.
6. To calculate this, we first need a common denominator, which in this case is 6. So, we have (3/6) - (1/6) = 2/6.
7. Simplifying this fraction gives us the final answer: $$ \boxed{2/6} $$.

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: NASA's Perseverance Rover was launched on July 30 2020 After traveling 292,526,838 miles, it landed on Mars in Jezero Crater about 6.5 months later. Which of the following is closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour?

Using exemplars:
1. The total distance traveled by NASA's Perseverance Rover is 292,526,838 miles.
2. The time taken to travel this distance is 6.5 months, which is equivalent to 6.5 * 30 = 195 days. We convert this into hours because we want the speed in miles per hour. So, 195 days * 24 hours/day = 4680 hours.
3. Now, we calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, the average speed is 292,526,838 miles / 4680 hours = 62,500 miles/hour approximately.

Therefore, the closest to the Rover's average interplanetary speed in miles per hour is $\boxed{62,500}$ mph.

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of 5-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent stamps, with exactly 20 of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $7.10 in postage?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's determine the total value of all the stamps Nicolas has. He has 20 stamps each of 5 cents, 10 cents, and 25 cents. So, the total value is:
   (20 * 5) + (20 * 10) + (20 * 25) = $100

2. Now, we want to maximize the number of stamps Nicolas can use for exactly $7.10. Since he has a large number of stamps and the total value is $100, it's likely that he will need to use some 25-cent stamps to reach this amount.

3. Let's start by calculating how many 25-cent stamps Nicolas can use without exceeding $7.10. This would be:
   $7.10 / $0.25 = 28 with a remainder of $0.30

4. Since we have a remainder, it means that we need to add some smaller value stamps (either 5-cent or 10-cent) to reach exactly $7.10. The remaining amount is $0.30.

5. If Nicolas uses all the 25-cent stamps and still needs more, he can use either 5-cent or 10-cent stamps. But since he has fewer 5-cent stamps than 10-cent stamps, it would be more efficient to use 10-cent stamps.

6. So, let's see how many 10-cent stamps Nicolas can use with the remaining $0.30. This would be:
   $0.30 / $0.10 = 3 stamps with no remainder

7. Therefore, Nicolas can use 28 twenty-five-cent stamps and 3 ten-cent stamps to make exactly $7.10 in postage.

In the range of numbers from 1 to 81, there are 27 numbers that are divisible by 3 (since every third number in this sequence is divisible by 3).\n\n2. **Minimum Requirement for Divisibility**: To ensure a product is divisible by 3, at least one number in the set of factors must be divisible by 3. This means that each row and column can contribute at least one number divisible by 3 to the product.\n\n3. **Maximizing Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: If we want to minimize the number of rows and columns with products divisible by 3, we should maximize the number of rows and columns without any number divisible by 3. This would mean having rows or columns composed entirely of numbers not divisible by 3.\n\n4. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Non-Divisible Rows/Columns**: There are 54 numbers from 1 to 81 that are not divisible by 3 (since there are 27 numbers divisible by 3). If we arrange these 54 numbers in rows and columns without any number divisible by 3, the maximum number of rows or columns we can have without a product divisible by 3 is determined by how many such rows or columns we can form with these 54 numbers.\n\n5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Rows/Columns with Divisible Products**: Since 54 is not divisible evenly into 9 (the number of rows or columns in the grid), we cannot have all 9 rows or all 9 columns without a product divisible by 3. Therefore, at least one row and one column must have a product divisible by 3.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The least number of rows and columns that could have a product divisible by 3 is at least two (one row and one column). This is because with 54 numbers not divisible by 3, we cannot avoid having a product divisible by 3 in at least one row and one column.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.',
