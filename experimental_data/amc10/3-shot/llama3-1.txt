Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the value of 9901*101 - 99*10101?

Using exemplars:
1. Multiply 9901 by 101. This can be done using long multiplication or by recognizing that it is close to the product of two numbers less than 100.
   Result: 999,999 + 2 = $$1000001$$

2. Multiply 99 by 10101. This can be done using long multiplication or by recognizing that it is close to the product of two numbers less than 100.
   Result: 99,9999 + 2 = $$1000001$$

3. Subtract the second result from the first one.
   $$1000001 - 1000001 = 0$$

Therefore, the solution to the problem is: $$\boxed{0}$$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's break down the multiplication into simpler parts to make it easier to calculate:
   9901 * 101 = (9900 + 1) * 101

2. Now, distribute the multiplication over addition:
   = 9900 * 101 + 1 * 101

3. Calculate each part separately:
   9900 * 101 = 999900
   1 * 101 = 101

4. Add the results together:
   999900 + 101 = 1000001

5. Now, let's break down the second multiplication into simpler parts as well:
   99 * 10101 = (99) * (10100 + 1)

6. Distribute the multiplication over addition:
   = 99 * 10100 + 99 * 1

7. Calculate each part separately:
   99 * 10100 = 999900
   99 * 1 = 99

8. Add the results together:
   999900 + 99 = 1000099

9. Subtract the second result from the first:
   1000001 - 1000099 = -98

So, the final answer is:
$$ \boxed{-98} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's break down the multiplication in the expression:
   a) 9901 * 101 = 9901 + 10101 (because 9901 is just 99*101 + 1)

2. Now, let's rewrite our expression as:
   a) (9901 + 10101) - 99*10101

3. Next, factor out 10101 from the first parentheses:
   a) 10101 * (1 + 1) - 99*10101

4. Now, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   a) 10101 * 2 - 99*10101

5. Factor out 10101 from both terms:
   a) 10101 * (2 - 99)

6. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   a) 10101 * (-97)

7. Finally, multiply:
   a) -989897

So, the final answer is \boxed{-989897}.

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form T = aL + bG, where a and b are constants, T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, as well as if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet?

Using exemplars:
1. We have two equations based on the given information:

69 = a * 1.5 + b * 800
   69 = a * 1.2 + b * 1100

2. To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can first multiply both sides of each equation by appropriate numbers to eliminate one of the variables:

207 = 3a + 800b (multiplying the first equation by 3)
   198 = 2a + 1100b (multiplying the second equation by 2)

3. Now, subtract the second new equation from the first one:

7 = a - 300b

4. We can now solve for 'a' in terms of 'b':

a = 300b + 7

5. Substitute this expression for 'a' into either of our original equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first one:

69 = (300b + 7) * 1.5 + b * 800
   69 = 450b + 10.5 + 800b
   69 - 10.5 = 1250b
   b ≈ 0.0514 (rounded to four decimal places)

6. Now, substitute the value of 'b' back into our expression for 'a':

a ≈ 300 * 0.0514 + 7
   a ≈ 15.42 + 7
   a ≈ 22.42 (rounded to two decimal places)

7. Finally, we can use the values of 'a' and 'b' in our original equation with the new values for 'L' and 'G':

T = 22.42 * 4.2 + 0.0514 * 4000
   T ≈ 93.68 + 205.6
   T ≈ 300.28

So, the model estimates it will take approximately \boxed{300} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find the values of the constants a and b in the equation T = aL + bG using the given information. We have two equations based on the given information:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) and
   69 = a(1.2) + b(1100).

2. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:
   0 = 0.3a - 300b.
   Divide by 0.3 to find b:
   b = 0.001.

3. Substitute b back into either equation to find a:
   69 = a(1.5) + (0.001)(800),
   so a = 46.

4. Now we have the model T = 46L + 0.001G. Substitute L = 4.2 and G = 4000 into the equation to find the estimated time:
   T = 46(4.2) + 0.001(4000).

5. Calculate the result:
   T = 193.2 + 4, so T = 197.2.

The final answer is \boxed{197}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We start with the given equation T = aL + bG, where T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet.

2. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet. So, we have the equation: 69 = a(1.5) + b(800).

3. The model also estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. So, we have another equation: 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100).

4. Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first one gives us: a(1.5 - 1.2) = 800 - 1100 => a = -300/0.3 = -1000.

5. Substituting a = -1000 into the first equation, we get: 69 = -1000(1.5) + b(800), which simplifies to b = (69 + 1500)/800 = 1.8375.

6. Now that we have the values of a and b, we can substitute L = 4.2 miles and G = 4000 feet into the original equation to find the time it will take to hike to the top: T = -1000(4.2) + 1.8375(4000).

7. This simplifies to: T = -4200 + 7350 = $3150$.

So, the model estimates that it will take \boxed{3150} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

   69 = 450b + 10.5 + 800b
   69 - 10.5 = 1250b
   58.5 = 1250b
   b ≈ 0.0468 (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, substitute the value of 'b' back into our expression for 'a':

a ≈ 300 * 0.0468 + 7
   a ≈ 14.04 + 7
   a ≈ 21.04

Finally, we can use the values of 'a' and 'b' in our original equation with the new values for 'L' and 'G':

T = 21.04 * 4.2 + 0.0468 * 4000
   T ≈ 88.37 + 187.12
   T ≈ 275.49

So, the model estimates it will take approximately $$275$$ minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find five distinct prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, etc.

2. We want to find a sum of five distinct primes that results in another prime number. Let's start with the smallest prime numbers and see if their sum is also prime:
   - The sum of the first three primes (2, 3, 5) is 10, which is not prime.
   - The sum of the next two primes (7, 11) plus the first one (2) is 20, which is also not prime.
   - However, if we add the next prime number (13) to this sum, we get 35, which is still not prime.
   - But, if we replace the smallest prime (2) with the next smallest prime (3), we get a new sum: 7 + 11 + 13 = 31, which is indeed a prime number.

3. Now that we have found a valid set of five distinct primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11) whose sum is another prime number (31), we can find the sum of their digits:
   - The sum of the digits in the set {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} is: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 18.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?" is $$\boxed{18}$$.

--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify the nature of the problem**: We are looking for the smallest prime number that can be expressed as the sum of five distinct primes.
2. **Consider the smallest odd prime numbers** (since 2 is the only even prime and cannot be used in this scenario): The next smallest primes after 2 are 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
3. **Check for a sum of five distinct primes**: We need to find if any combination of these primes can sum up to another prime number. Start with the smallest primes:
   - $3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 26$, which is not a prime number.
   - Next, try excluding the smallest primes and including larger ones: $3 + 5 + 7 + 13 = 28$, also not a prime.
   - Continue this process until we find a valid combination: $3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 36$ (not prime), $3 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 34$ (not prime), $3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 36$ (not prime), and so forth.
4. **Find the combination**: After several trials, we find that $3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 49$, which is not a prime number. Continue this until you find:
   - $3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 36$ (not prime), $3 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 34$ (not prime), and finally, $3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 36$.
5. **Identify the smallest prime that fits the criteria**: The first valid sum we found was $3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 36$, but it is not a prime number. We need to continue this process until we find the correct sum. After several trials, we identify:
   - $3 + 5 + 11 + 13 + 29 = 61$ (61 is a prime number).
6. **Sum of digits**: The final answer is the sum of the digits of this prime number. For 61, the sum of digits is $6 + 1 = 7$.

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: The number 2024 is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand that any integer $n$ can be expressed as a sum of $d(n)$ positive divisors, where $d(n)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$. This is because each divisor $k$ of $n$ corresponds to another divisor $\frac{n}{k}$.
2. The sum of these divisors can be calculated using the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{d(n)} \frac{n}{i} = n\sum_{i=1}^{d(n)}\frac{1}{i}$.
3. We are looking for a way to express $2024$ as a sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers, so we need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $2024 = k\sum_{i=1}^{d(k)}\frac{1}{i}$ and $\frac{k}{2} < 99$.
4. To do this, we start by listing out the sums of divisors for integers from $1$ to $50$ because the average density drops after this point and there is no need to continue.
5. We find that the sum of divisors of $32$ is $\frac{9}{2}$, so $k=2048\cdot \frac{2}{9}=417$. However, this does not satisfy our condition because $417$ is greater than $2024$.
6. The sum of divisors of $35$ is $\frac{13}{4}$, so $k=2024\cdot \frac{4}{13}=648$. This does not satisfy our condition either because $648$ is greater than $99$.
7. The sum of divisors of $38$ is $\frac{19}{5}$, so $k=2024\cdot \frac{5}{19}=534$. However, this does not satisfy our condition because $534$ is greater than $99$.
8. The sum of divisors of $46$ is $\frac{23}{7}$, so $k=2024\cdot \frac{7}{23}=592$. This satisfies all our conditions, so we have found our answer.

Therefore, the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write the sum $2024$ is $\boxed{592}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Identify the goal:** We want to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers using the smallest possible number of these two-digit numbers.

2. **Understand the range of two-digit numbers:** Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. The sum of all possible two-digit numbers is:
   \[
   10 + 11 + \cdots + 99 = (10 + 99) \times 9 = 1090
   \]

3. **Identify the difference to be made up:** We need to find how much more than our maximum sum of two-digit numbers (1090) we have to reach 2024:
   \[
   2024 - 1090 = 934
   \]

4. **Find the largest possible two-digit number that is less than or equal to 934:** The largest two-digit number is 99, but it's too large as:
   \[
   2 \times 99 = 198 < 934
   \]
   So, we check the next possible two-digit number:
   \[
   100 \text{ (not a two-digit number)}
   \]
   The next largest is 98.

5. **Calculate how many times 98 fits into 934:**
   \[
   \frac{934}{98} \approx 9.531
   \]
   Since we can only use whole numbers of two-digit sums, we use 9 times:
   \[
   9 \times 98 = 882
   \]

6. **Determine the remainder:**
   \[
   934 - 882 = 52
   \]

7. **Find how many more two-digit numbers are needed to make up the remaining 52:** We need two-digit numbers whose sum is at least 52:
   \[
   10 + 42 = 52
   \]

8. **Calculate the total number of two-digit numbers used:** We have used 9 times 98 and added one more number (10 + 42):
   \[
   9 + 1 = 10
   \]

9. **Conclude with the final answer:**
   \[
   \boxed{10}
   \]
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's understand that a two-digit number ranges from 10 to 99. The maximum sum we can get from two such numbers is 99 + 98 =

197. However, we want the least number of two-digit numbers to make up 2024. So, let's start with larger numbers.

2. If we take 99 as one of our numbers, then we need another number that adds up to 2024 - 99 = 1925. The next largest two-digit number is 98, so now we have 1925 - 98 = 1827 left to make up with the remaining numbers.

3. The next step would be to use 97, but that would leave us with 1827 - 97 = 1730, which is not possible because the sum of any two two-digit numbers cannot exceed 196. So, we need to adjust our approach.

4. Instead, let's try using smaller numbers. If we take 20 as one of our numbers, then we need another number that adds up to 2024 - 20 = 2004. The largest two-digit number we can use now is 99, so we have 2004 - 99 = 1905 left to make up with the remaining numbers.

5. Now, if we take 98 as our next number, then we need another number that adds up to 1905 - 98 = 1807. The largest two-digit number we can use now is 97, so we have 1807 - 97 = 1710 left to make up with the remaining numbers.

6. Continuing this pattern, we find that the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write 2024 as a sum is 32:

$$ \boxed{32} $$

## Step 1: Understand that any integer $n$ can be expressed as a sum of $d(n)$ positive divisors, where $d(n)$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$.

To find the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write the sum 2024, we need to understand how 2024 can be broken down into smaller parts. However, this step seems more about understanding a general property of integers rather than directly addressing the problem at hand.

## Step 2: The sum of these divisors can be calculated using the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{d(n)} \frac{n}{i} = n\sum_{i=1}^{d(n)}\frac{1}{i}$.

This step provides a method to calculate the sum of divisors, but again, it does not directly address the problem at hand. It seems more relevant to understanding how many divisors an integer has rather than breaking down 2024 into two-digit numbers.

## Step 3: Identify the range of possible values for $k$ such that $k\sum_{i=1}^{d(k)}\frac{1}{i}$ results in a number close to but not greater than 2024, and $\frac{k}{2} < 99$.

This step involves finding a suitable value for $k$ based on the constraints provided. The idea is to find an integer whose sum of divisors (when multiplied by some factor) does not exceed 2024 and also satisfies the condition that half of it must be less than 99.

## Step 4: Calculate the sums of divisors from $1$ to $50$, and then select a suitable value for $k$ based on these calculations.

Given the constraint that $\frac{k}{2} < 99$, we're looking for an integer that is less than twice our target, but in this step, it seems like specific numbers are being checked rather than following through with a method to determine the least number of two-digit numbers needed.

## Step 5: The sum of divisors of $38$ is $\frac{19}{5}$; therefore, $k=2024\cdot \frac{5}{19}=534$. However, this does not satisfy our condition because $534$ is greater than $99$, which contradicts the requirement that half of $k$ must be less than 99.

This step seems to go through a process of elimination but doesn't seem to follow through with finding the least number of two-digit numbers. The calculations here might have been done to illustrate how one would think about solving the problem, but they do not lead directly to an answer based on the steps outlined for this particular example solution.

## Step 6: List out possible values of $k$ such that $\frac{k}{2} < 99$, and find corresponding sums of divisors until finding a suitable match.

This step seems to involve trial and error with various values, but again, it doesn't follow the steps laid out in the example solution. The process described here appears to be an attempt at solving the problem but does not align with the examples provided earlier.

## Step 7: Instead of following through with these calculations, let's reconsider our approach by focusing on breaking down 2024 into two-digit numbers directly.

Given that we've been presented with a series of steps that don't seem to lead to a straightforward solution based on the initial problem statement and example solutions provided, it might be more productive to consider other approaches for solving this specific problem. The examples given earlier appear to involve complex calculations or processes that do not align with breaking down 2024 into its constituent parts as two-digit numbers.

## Step 8: Break down 2024 into the largest possible two-digit number (99), leaving us with $2024 - 99 = 1925$. Then, see if we can use another large two-digit number to make up for this difference.

This step aligns more closely with breaking down 2024 into its smallest parts as two-digit numbers. By starting with the largest possible two-digit number and working our way down, we can systematically find combinations that sum up to 2024.

## Step 9: Continue using large two-digit numbers until we cannot use any more without exceeding 196 (the maximum sum of two two-digit numbers).

Using a combination of 99 and another large two-digit number could be one approach, but the problem requires identifying the least number of such combinations needed to reach 2024.

## Step 10: Try breaking down 2024 into smaller parts with two-digit numbers. Starting with 20 as our first number leaves us with $2024 - 20 = 2004$. Then, use 99, which leaves us with $2004 - 99 = 1905$.

This step is more aligned with systematically trying to break down 2024 into the least possible number of two-digit numbers. It involves starting with smaller numbers and increasing in size rather than going directly for the largest possible combination.

## Step 11: Continue this pattern, using 98 as our next number, which leaves us with $1905 - 98 = 1807$. Then use 97 to leave $1807 - 97 = 1710$.

This step involves continuing the process of breaking down the remaining sum into smaller two-digit numbers until we reach a point where adding any more numbers would require going below 10, which is not possible for two-digit numbers.

## Step 12: By following this pattern and systematically trying different combinations of two-digit numbers, it becomes clear that the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write the sum 2024 as accurately as possible will be found by considering each step's contribution to reaching our target without exceeding it.

This final step acknowledges the process of breaking down 2024 into smaller parts using two-digit numbers and recognizing that the pattern followed leads us closer to identifying the least number of such combinations needed.

## Step 13: After carefully following this method, we find that the smallest number of two-digit numbers that can sum up to 2024 without exceeding it is $$32.$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: What is the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to factorize 2024 into its prime factors: $2024 = 2^3 \times 11 \times 23$.
2. Next, we need to find the least value of n such that n! contains at least three factors of 2, one factor of 11, and one factor of 23.
3. To ensure that n! has at least three factors of 2, we can choose $n = 6$ because $6! = 720$ which is divisible by $2^3$. However, $6!$ does not contain any factors of 11 or 23.
4. To ensure that n! has at least one factor of 11 and one factor of 23, we can choose $n = 23$ because $23!$ is divisible by both 11 and 23.
5. Therefore, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is $\boxed{23}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find the prime factorization of 2024. Prime factorization is the process of determining the prime numbers that multiply together to make a certain number.

2. The prime factors of 2024 are 2, 2, 2, 3, and 13 (since 2024 = 2^3 * 3 * 13).

3. Now, we need to determine the least value of n such that n! contains at least as many factors of each prime in 2024's factorization.

4. Since there are three factors of 2 and one factor of 3 in 2024's factorization, we need to find the smallest value of n that includes these factors in its factorial.

5. We know that for any integer k, the factorial k! contains at least as many factors of 2 as there are in the first k even numbers (since every second number is a multiple of 2). So, we just need to find the smallest value of n such that n contains at least three factors of 2 and one factor of 3.

6. The smallest values of n that contain these factors are n=6 (which has three factors of 2: 2, 4, and 6) and n=12 (which has more than three factors of 2 and contains a factor of 3).

7. However, we want the least value of n, so our answer is $$ \boxed{6} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Factorize 2024 into its prime factors: 2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 23
2. The least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 should have all these prime factors in its factorial.
3. For the prime factor 2, we need at least three instances of it, which will be present in 6! (since 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 > 6)
4. For the prime factor 11 and 23, they will first appear in their respective factorials, i.e., 11! and 23!
5. Therefore, we need to find the least value of n such that n is greater than or equal to 23 (since both 11 and 23 are prime and appear only once in the factorial).
6. Hence, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is $$ \boxed{23} $$

To find the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024, we first need to factorize 2024 into its prime factors.

1. Factorize 2024 into its prime factors: $2024 = 2^3 \times 11 \times 23$

Now, let's analyze the prime factors and determine what they mean for n!:

* The prime factor 2 needs at least three instances of it, which will be present in 6! (since 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 > 6).
* The prime factor 11 needs one instance of it, which will first appear in 11!.
* The prime factor 23 also needs one instance of it, which will first appear in 23!.

Considering these conditions, we need to find the least value of n that satisfies all three requirements.

Since both 11 and 23 are prime numbers and appear only once in their respective factorials (11! and 23!), the smallest value of n that includes both factors is $n = 23$.

Therefore, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is $$ \boxed{23} $$

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: What is the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA?

Using exemplars:
1. The goal is to find the minimum number of swaps required to transform "ABCDEF" into "FEDCBA".
2. Notice that in the target string, all letters are in reverse order compared to the initial string. Therefore, each letter must be moved to a new position, which means every letter will change its place exactly once.
3. For example, 'A' needs to be swapped with 'F', and it cannot reach its final position in fewer than 5 moves because there are 5 letters before 'F'. Similarly, the same applies to other letters.
4. This logic holds true for all letters, so we can conclude that at least 6 swaps are necessary (one for each letter).
5. We can achieve this by performing a sequence of swaps as follows:
   - Swap A and F (AFBCDE)
   - Swap B and E (AFBECD)
   - Swap C and D (AFBEDC)
   - Swap A and F again (FAFBED)
   - Swap B and E again (FABEFD)
   - Swap F with itself (FEDCBA)
6. After these 6 swaps, we have successfully transformed the string into "FEDCBA".
7. Therefore, the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters needed to change the string ABCDEF to FEDCBA is $$ \boxed{6} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to figure out how many swaps it takes to reverse the order of the letters in the given string "ABCDEF".
2. Since there are six letters in the string, we can think of each letter as a point on a line (or number line). The first letter 'A' is at position 1, 'B' is at position 2, and so on, until 'F' is at position 6.
3. To reverse this order, we need to swap the pairs of letters that are farthest apart. We start with the pair (1, 6), then move to (2, 5), and finally (3, 4).
4. Each of these swaps changes the relative positions of two points by one unit closer to the center. So, after three swaps, all six points will be in their correct reversed order.
5. Therefore, it takes a minimum of 3 successive swaps of adjacent letters to change the string "ABCDEF" to "FEDCBA".

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$
--------------------------------------------------
1. The first step is to identify the problem, which is to determine the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA.
2. Next, we should visualize or imagine the process of swapping the letters in the given string to reach the desired string.
3. The last letter in the desired string is 'A'. In order for 'A' to be in its final position, it must be moved from its initial position at the end of the string all the way to the front.
4. Each time we swap two adjacent letters, we move one letter towards its goal by one step. So, we need to perform this swapping process 5 times (since there are 5 letters in total) to get 'A' to its final position.
5. After 'A' is in the front, we have the string 'AEDCFB'. The next letter that needs to be moved to its final position is 'B', which is also at the end of the string. We apply the same process as before and swap adjacent letters until 'B' is in its correct spot. This requires 5 more swaps.
6. Now, we have the string 'BAEDCF'. The next letter that needs to be moved is 'C', which only requires 3 swaps since it is closer to its final position than 'A' and 'B' were.
7. After moving 'C', we are left with the string 'CBDAFE', where 'D' is in its correct spot.
8. Next, we need to move 'E'. Since there is only one letter before 'E', it will take just 1 swap to get it to its final position. This gives us the string 'EBADCFA'.
9. Finally, we need to move 'F' to its correct position. However, since 'F' is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed for 'F'.
10. Therefore, the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA is 5 (for 'A') + 5 (for 'B') + 3 (for 'C') + 1 (for 'E') = 14.

So, the final answer is $$ \boxed{14} $$.

2. Since all letters in the target string are in reverse order compared to the initial string, each letter must be moved to a new position.

Example:
1. First, we need to visualize or imagine the process of swapping the letters in the given string to reach the desired string.
2. The last letter in the desired string is 'A'. In order for 'A' to be in its final position, it must be moved from its initial position at the end of the string all the way to the front.
3. Each time we swap two adjacent letters, we move one letter towards its goal by one step. So, we need to perform this swapping process 5 times (since there are 5 letters in total) to get 'A' to its final position.

However, we should consider that each swap moves the first letter of the pair towards the end and the last letter of the pair towards the front. Therefore, after moving 'A' to the front, we have the string 'AEFBCD'. 

Now, let's apply a similar approach for the remaining letters:

* Moving 'B' to its final position requires 4 swaps (since there are 4 letters before it).
* After that, 'C' is in its correct spot.
* Next, moving 'D' to its final position requires only 1 swap.

So, in total, we need 5 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 10 swaps.

Therefore, the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters needed to change the string ABCDEF to FEDCBA is:

$$ \boxed{10} $$

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: The product of three integers is 60. What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

Using exemplars:
1. To find the least possible positive sum of three integers that multiply to 60, we first need to factorize 60 into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
2. Now, let's look for a combination of three factors (using some or all of the prime factors) that gives us the smallest positive sum. We can see that using the factors 1, 4, and 15, we have $1 \cdot 4 \cdot 15 = 60$ and $1 + 4 + 15 = 20$.
3. To verify that this is the least possible sum, we can try other combinations of factors:
	* $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 = 60$ but $2 + 3 + 10 = 15$, which is less than 20.
	* However, since we're looking for the least possible positive sum and $1 + 4 + 15$ already gives us a smaller sum than any other combination, we can conclude that the least possible positive sum of three integers that multiply to 60 is $\boxed{20}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find the factors of 60. They are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

2. Now, we want to find three integers whose product is 60 and have the smallest possible positive sum. To do this, we should try to use the largest factors as much as possible since they will contribute more to the sum.

3. From our list of factors, we can see that the largest factor less than or equal to 60 is 30. So, we'll start by dividing 60 by 30, which gives us 2. This means one of our integers will be 30 and another will be 2 (since we want to maximize the size of our integers).

4. Multiplying these two together, we get 60. But we still need another integer that multiplies with them to give us a product of 60 again. Since 30 * 2 = 60, any other integer multiplied by either 30 or 2 will result in a number greater than 60. Therefore, the only possible choice left is 1.

5. So, our three integers are 30, 2, and 1. Their sum is: 30 + 2 + 1 = 33.

$$ \boxed{33} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find all sets of three integers whose product equals 60. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and

30. Since we want the least possible positive sum, we should consider combinations that include larger factors first.

2. The largest factor less than or equal to 60 is 30. If one of the integers is 30, then the product of the other two integers must be 2 (since 60 / 30 = 2). However, there are no two positive integers whose product is

2. So, we cannot have 30 as one of the integers.

3. The next largest factor is

20. If one of the integers is 20, then the product of the other two integers must be 3 (since 60 / 20 = 3). Again, there are no two positive integers whose product is 3. So, we cannot have 20 as one of the integers.

4. The next largest factor is

15. If one of the integers is 15, then the product of the other two integers must be 4 (since 60 / 15 = 4). In this case, there are two positive integers whose product is 4: 2 and 2. However, we want to minimize the sum of the three integers, so we should choose the smallest possible values for the other two integers.

5. Therefore, the least possible positive sum of the three integers is 15 + 2 + 2 = \boxed{19}.

1. First, we need to find all sets of three integers whose product equals 60. The factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30.

2. Since we want the least possible positive sum, we should consider combinations that include larger factors first.

3. We can start by dividing 60 by each of these factors to see if we get a product of 60:
	* If one of the integers is 1, then the other two integers must have a product of 60 (since 60 / 1 = 60), which means they could be any combination of three factors that multiply together to give 60. However, this will not minimize the sum since we can choose smaller numbers.
	* If one of the integers is 2, then the other two integers must have a product of 30 (since 60 / 2 = 30). This could be either 1 * 3 * 10 or 3 * 5. The smallest possible combination in this case is: $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 = 60$ but $2 + 3 + 10 = 15$, which we will test for other combinations.
	* If one of the integers is 3, then the other two integers must have a product of 20 (since 60 / 3 = 20), which could be either 1 * 4 * 5 or 2 * 10. Again, the smallest possible combination in this case is: $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 10 = 60$ but $3 + 2 + 10 = 15$, which we will test for other combinations.
	* If one of the integers is 4, then the other two integers must have a product of 15 (since 60 / 4 = 15), which could be either 1 * 3 * 5 or 5. However, since we want to minimize the sum and we already found smaller combinations with sums of 15 in previous steps, this will not give us a smaller sum.

4. Therefore, looking at all possible combinations with larger factors first, our least possible positive sum is: $$19$$

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria work in a chocolate factory. On Monday Amy, Bomani, and Charlie started working at 1:00 PM and were able to pack 4, 3, and 3 packages, respectively, every 3 minutes. At some later time, Daria joined the group, and Daria was able to pack 5 packages every 4 minutes. Together, they finished packing 450 packages at exactly 2:45 PM. At what time did Daria join the group?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie were able to pack in the first hour (from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM). Since they work for 60 minutes, each of them would have packed $60 \div 3 = \boxed{20}$ packages.

2. Now, let's find out how many packages they were able to pack together in the first hour. That would be $20 + 20 + 20 = \boxed{60}$ packages.

3. Since they finished packing all 450 packages by 2:45 PM, that means they packed the remaining $450 - 60 = \boxed{390}$ packages after Daria joined them.

4. Let's assume that Daria started working at x minutes past 1:00 PM. Since she packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, she would have packed $\frac{x}{4} \cdot 5 = \boxed{\frac{5x}{4}}$ packages in the time she worked.

5. The total number of packages that Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria were able to pack together after Daria joined them is $60 + \frac{5x}{4} = 390$.

6. Solving this equation for x gives us $x = \boxed{\frac{1200}{5}} = \boxed{240}$ minutes.

7. Converting this time into hours and minutes, we get $240 \div 60 = 4$ hours and $240 - 4 \cdot 60 = \boxed{0}$ minutes.

8. Therefore, Daria joined the group at 1:00 PM + 4 hours = $\boxed{\text{5:00 PM}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Calculate Individual Packing Rates:**
   - Amy packs $4$ packages every $3$ minutes, so her rate is $\frac{4}{3}$ packages per minute.
   - Bomani packs $3$ packages every $3$ minutes, so his rate is $1$ package per minute.
   - Charlie also packs $3$ packages every $3$ minutes, so his rate is also $1$ package per minute.
   - Daria packs $5$ packages every $4$ minutes, so her rate is $\frac{5}{4}$ packages per minute.

2. **Calculate Combined Packing Rate:**
   - Initially, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie together have a combined rate of $\frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1 = \frac{10}{3}$ packages per minute.
   - After Daria joins, the combined rate becomes $\frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1 + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{26}{12} = \frac{13}{6}$ packages per minute.

3. **Determine Time Amy, Bomani, and Charlie Work Alone:**
   - They start packing at $1:00$ PM and work until Daria joins. Let $t$ be the time in minutes they work alone.
   - The number of packages they pack is $\frac{10}{3}t$.

4. **Determine Time All Four Work Together:**
   - They finish packing at $2:45$ PM, which is $60 + 45 = 105$ minutes after starting.
   - The time they work alone plus the time all four work together equals $105$ minutes: $t + \frac{45}{\frac{13}{6}} = 105$.

5. **Solve for $t$:**
   - Solve $\frac{10}{3}t + \frac{270}{13} = 105$.
   - Multiply through by $13$: $40t + 270 = 1365$.
   - Subtract $270$ from both sides: $40t = 1095$.
   - Divide by $40$: $t = \frac{1095}{40} = 27.375$.

6. **Calculate When Daria Joined:**
   - Since Amy, Bomani, and Charlie worked alone for $27.375$ minutes, they finished packing at $1:00 + \frac{27.375}{60} = 1:04:23$.
   - Therefore, Daria joined the group at approximately $\boxed{1:04:23}$ PM.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's calculate how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie could pack per minute. Since they packed 4, 3, and 3 packages every 3 minutes, respectively, their rates are:
   - Amy: 4/3 = approximately 1.33 packages per minute
   - Bomani: 3/3 = 1 package per minute
   - Charlie: 3/3 = 1 package per minute

2. The total rate of packing for the three of them is therefore:
   1.33 + 1 + 1 = approximately 3.33 packages per minute

3. Since they were able to pack a total of 450 packages in the hour between 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM, we can calculate how many minutes it took them to pack these packages at their combined rate:
   450 / 3.33 = approximately 135 minutes

4. Therefore, Daria must have joined the group during the last 15 minutes of this period (from 2:00 PM to 2:15 PM), since they finished packing at exactly 2:45 PM and had 135 minutes of work in total.

So, $$ \boxed{Daria \ joined \ the \ group \ between \ 2:00 \ PM \ and \ 2:15 \ PM} $$

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: In how many ways can 6 juniors and 6 seniors form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 juniors for the first team from a group of 6 juniors. This can be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, where $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of combinations of $n$ items taken $k$ at a time. So, $\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15$.

2. Similarly, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 seniors for the first team from a group of 6 seniors. This can also be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways, which is again 15. So, there are $15 \cdot 15 = 225$ ways to form the first team.

3. Now, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 juniors for the second team from a group of 4 remaining juniors (since 2 juniors have already been selected for the first team). This can be done in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways. So, $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$.

4. Similarly, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 seniors for the second team from a group of 4 remaining seniors (since 2 seniors have already been selected for the first team). This can also be done in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways, which is again 6. So, there are $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ ways to form the second team.

5. Finally, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 juniors for the third team from a group of 2 remaining juniors (since 4 juniors have already been selected for the first two teams). This can be done in $\binom{2}{2}$ ways. So, $\binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1$.

6. Similarly, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 seniors for the third team from a group of 2 remaining seniors (since 4 seniors have already been selected for the first two teams). This can also be done in $\binom{2}{2}$ ways, which is again 1. So, there are $1 \cdot 1 = 1$ way to form the third team.

7. Therefore, the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors is $225 \cdot 36 \cdot 1 = \boxed{8100}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to select 2 juniors from the group of 6. This can be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways. The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to order.

2. Similarly, we need to select 2 seniors from the group of 6. This can also be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.

3. Since the selection of juniors and seniors are independent events, the total number of ways to form a team with 2 juniors and 2 seniors is the product of the number of ways to choose 2 juniors and the number of ways to choose 2 seniors. This can be represented as $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{6}{2}$.

4. However, we want to form 3 such teams. To account for this, we need to raise the product obtained in step 3 to the power of 3 (since we're forming three teams). This can be represented as $(\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{6}{2})^3$.

5. Calculating $\binom{6}{2}$ gives us 15 (since there are 15 ways to choose 2 items from a set of 6). Substituting this into our expression gives us $(15 \times 15)^3 = 25^3$.

6. Finally, calculating $25^3$ gives us the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors. This is equal to $\boxed{15625}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 juniors for the first team. This can be done using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors from 6 is C(6, 2).

2. Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 seniors for the first team. This can be done in the same way, so the number of ways is also C(6, 2).

3. After forming the first team, we are left with 4 juniors and 4 seniors. We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 juniors for the second team from these remaining juniors. This can be done using combinations again, so the number of ways is C(4, 2).

4. Similarly, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 seniors for the second team from the remaining seniors. The number of ways is also C(4, 2).

5. After forming the second team, we are left with 2 juniors and 2 seniors. These can be paired up in only one way to form the third team.

6. To find the total number of ways to form these teams, we multiply the number of ways for each step together. This gives us C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(4, 2).

7. Calculating these combinations gives us (15 * 15 * 6 * 6) = 900 * 36 = 32400 ways to form the teams.

So, the final answer is $$ \boxed{32400} $$.

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Consider the following operation. Given a positive integer n, if n is a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n/3. If n is not a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n+10. Then continue this process. Suppose you start with n=100. What value results if you perform this operation exactly 100 times?

Using exemplars:
1. Start with n = 100. Since 100 is not a multiple of 3, we add 10 to get 110.
2. 110 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 again to get 120.
3. 120 is a multiple of 3, so we divide by 3 to get 40.
4. 40 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 to get 50.
5. 50 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 again to get 60.
6. 60 is a multiple of 3, so we divide by 3 to get 20.
7. 20 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 to get 30.
8. 30 is a multiple of 3, so we divide by 3 to get 10.
9. 10 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 to get 20.
10. 20 is not a multiple of 3, so we add 10 again to get 30.
11. 30 is a multiple of 3, so we divide by 3 to get 10.
12. We notice that the sequence repeats every three steps: 10, 20, 30, then back to 10 again.
13. Since we perform this operation exactly 100 times and the sequence repeats every three steps, we will have performed it 33 full cycles (with a remainder of 1).
14. Therefore, the final value of n is 10.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Start with $n = 100$.
2. Perform the operation 100 times as described in the question.
3. After 50 iterations, $n$ will be 16 (since we only add 10 when $n$ is not a multiple of 3).
4. Now, $n$ is no longer a multiple of 3, so for the next 50 iterations, $n$ will increase by 10 each time until it reaches 200 (which is a multiple of 3).
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 for another 50 iterations. This will bring $n$ back to 16 again.
6. Since we have already performed the operation an even number of times, and since our initial value was even, our final answer must also be even.
7. Therefore, after 100 iterations, the resulting value is $\boxed{16}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Start with n = 100. Since 100 is a multiple of 3, replace n by n/3: n = 100/3 ≈ 33.33, but since we're working with integers, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 33.
2. Now n = 33. Since 33 is not a multiple of 3, replace n by n + 10: n = 33 + 10 = 43.
3. Repeat this process for a total of 98 more times. However, since we're only asked to perform the operation exactly 100 times and we've already done one step, we need to perform the operation 99 more times starting from n = 43.
4. After performing the operation 99 more times, we end up with a value that is greater than 62 but less than 70 (you can verify this by following the steps above or through calculation).
5. The final answer should be between dollar signs: $$ \boxed{63} $$

Let's analyze the problem:

1. Start with $n = 100$.
2. Since 100 is a multiple of 3, replace $n$ by $n/3$: $n = 100/3 \approx 33.33$, but since we're working with integers, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 33.
3. Now $n = 33$. Since 33 is not a multiple of 3, replace $n$ by $n + 10$: $n = 33 + 10 = 43$.
4. We can see that after performing this operation once, we get $n = 43$.

Now, let's analyze the pattern:

* When $n$ is a multiple of 3, we divide it by 3 and get a new value that is smaller than the original value.
* When $n$ is not a multiple of 3, we add 10 to it and get a new value that is larger than the original value.

Since we start with $n = 100$, which is a large number, and since the operation involves adding 10 or dividing by 3, we can expect the sequence to oscillate around a certain value. However, because we are only performing this operation an even number of times (100), we will end up at an even value.

Let's analyze the first few iterations:

1. $n = 43$
2. $n = 53$ (not a multiple of 3, so add 10)
3. $n = 63$ (not a multiple of 3, so add 10)
4. $n = 73$ (not a multiple of 3, so add 10)

Notice that every time we add 10 to a number that is not a multiple of 3, the resulting value is also not a multiple of 3. This means that for the next two iterations, we will continue adding 10.

After performing this operation an even number of times (100), we can expect the final value to be close to the value obtained after the last full cycle (i.e., when $n = 63$ and we add 10 twice). Let's analyze what happens:

* After the first two iterations, $n = 73$.
* After adding 10 four more times (to make it an even number of additions), we get $n = 83$.
* However, since we are only performing this operation exactly 100 times, and since we have already added 10 five times starting from $n = 43$, we will reach a value that is greater than 63 but less than 70.

Now, let's analyze the last few iterations:

1. After reaching $n = 83$ (which is not a multiple of 3), we add 10 to get $n = 93$.
2. Next, we add 10 again to get $n = 103$, but this time it's a multiple of 3 (specifically, 3 × 34 + 1).
3. Since $n$ is now a multiple of 3, we divide by 3 to get a new value: $n = 103/3 \approx 34.33$. However, since we're working with integers, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 34.
4. Now, $n = 34$. Since 34 is not a multiple of 3, replace $n$ by $n + 10$: $n = 34 + 10 = 44$.

Notice that after performing this operation once more (after reaching $n = 103/3 \approx 34.33$, which rounds down to 34), we get $n = 44$. This means that the sequence will oscillate around a certain value, specifically between values of the form $n = 34 + 10k$ and $n = 43 - 10l$ for non-negative integers $k$ and $l$.

However, because we are only performing this operation an even number of times (100), we will end up at a value that is close to the midpoint of the oscillation. Since we have already performed several operations and reached values such as $n = 34$, $n = 44$, and $n = 43$ - $10 \times 3 + 1 = 10$, we can expect the final value to be around this area.

Therefore, after performing this operation exactly 100 times, we end up with a value between $$63$$ and $$70.$$

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: How many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m?

Using exemplars:
1. We are looking for ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. The square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers, so n^2 - 49 must be non-negative:
   n^2 - 49 >= 0

3. Rearranging the inequality gives us:
   n^2 >= 49

4. Taking the square root of both sides (remembering that the square root is always positive), we get:
   |n| >= 7

5. This means that n can be any integer greater than or equal to 7 or less than or equal to -7.

6. For each possible value of n, we can find the corresponding value of m by solving the original equation:
   sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m
   m^2 = n^2 - 49
   0 <= m^2 < n^2 (since m is an integer and the square root function only returns non-negative numbers)

7. This inequality tells us that m can be any integer from 0 to |n|-1, inclusive.

8. Therefore, for each possible value of n, there are |n| possible values of m.

9. Since n can take on infinitely many values, we cannot list all the ordered pairs (m, n). However, we can describe them: for each integer k >= 0 or k <= -7, there are |k| ordered pairs (m, n) such that sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

10. The final answer is not a single number; it's a description of the infinite set of ordered pairs that satisfy the equation:

$$ \boxed{(m, n)\text{ where }|n| >= 7\text{ and }0 <= m < |n|} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. We are given the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m, where m and n are integers.
2. Since m is an integer, then sqrt(n^2 - 49) must also be an integer (because the square root of a number squared results in that original number).
3. The only way for sqrt(n^2 - 49) to be an integer is if n^2 - 49 is a perfect square itself (since the square root of a perfect square is always an integer).
4. Let's denote the perfect square as k, so we have n^2 - 49 = k.
5. Rearranging this equation gives us n^2 = k + 49.
6. Now we need to find all possible integer values of n that make n^2 a perfect square plus 49.
7. Since 7^2 = 49, then any number n that is one more or one less than a multiple of 7 will satisfy the equation. So, our candidates for n are: 6, 13, 20, 27, ... and so on.
8. However, we must also consider negative values of n since sqrt(n^2 - 49) = |m|, meaning m could be positive or negative. Therefore, our complete set of candidates for n includes: -6, 6, -13, 13, -20, 20, ...
9. To find the number of ordered pairs (m, n), we need to pair each candidate value of n with its corresponding value of m calculated as sqrt(n^2 - 49).
10. After calculating all possible values for m and n, we get the following ordered pairs: (-6, 7), (6, 7), (-13, 15), (13, 15), ...
11. This pattern continues indefinitely with each pair differing by a difference of 4 between consecutive values for m and n respectively.
12. Hence, there are infinitely many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

$$ \boxed{\text{Infinitely many}} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. The equation is sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m, which means that m is a non-negative integer and n is an integer such that n^2 - 49 is a perfect square.
2. Since n^2 - 49 is a perfect square, it must be greater than or equal to 0 (since the square root of a negative number is not defined for real numbers). Therefore, n^2 must be greater than or equal to 49.
3. The smallest possible value for n^2 that satisfies this condition is 49, which occurs when n = ±7. Substituting these values into the equation gives m = sqrt(49 - 49) = 0. Therefore, (0, 7) and (0, -7) are two possible solutions.
4. For larger values of n, we can find other solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of 14 to/from 49 (since 49 is the square of 7 and 14 is twice 7). This gives us new values for n^2 that are still perfect squares.
5. For example, if we add 14 to 49, we get 63, which is not a perfect square. However, if we subtract 14 from 49, we get 35, which is the square of sqrt(35). Substituting these values into the equation gives m = sqrt(35 - 49) = sqrt(-14), which is not a real number. Therefore, there are no new solutions for n when n^2 = 63 or n^2 = 35.
6. In fact, we can see that all larger values of n will result in non-integer or negative values for m, since sqrt(n^2 - 49) must always be less than or equal to |n| (the absolute value of n). Therefore, there are no more solutions for m and n that satisfy the equation.
7. In conclusion, the only ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m are (0, 7) and (0, -7).

Therefore, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{2} $$

1. We are looking for ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. The square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers, so n^2 - 49 must be non-negative:
   n^2 - 49 >= 0

3. Rearranging the inequality gives us:
   n^2 >= 49

4. Taking the square root of both sides (remembering that the square root is always positive), we get:
   |n| >= 7

5. This means that n can be any integer greater than or equal to 7 or less than or equal to -7.

6. For each possible value of n, we can find the corresponding value of m by solving the original equation:
   sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m
   m^2 = n^2 - 49
   0 <= m^2 < n^2 (since m is an integer and the square root function only returns non-negative numbers)

7. This inequality tells us that m can be any integer from 0 to |n|-1, inclusive.

8. Therefore, for each possible value of n, there are |n| possible values of m.

9. Since n can take on infinitely many values (both positive and negative), we cannot list all the ordered pairs (m, n). However, we can describe them: for each integer k >= 0 or k <= -7, there are |k| ordered pairs (m, n) such that sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

10. Since n has two values of symmetry (-n and +n), then it will have twice the number of corresponding values for m.

Therefore, we can conclude that the equation has infinitely many solutions because there are infinitely many integers.

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations from this list (translation 2 units right, 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin, reflection across x-axis, dilation at origin with scale factor 2), how many commute?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand what "commute" means in this context. Commuting transformations are those that can be applied in any order without changing the result.

2. Now, let's analyze each transformation and see how it interacts with the others:
   - Translation 2 units right: This transformation moves all points of a shape 2 units to the right. It doesn't affect the other transformations since they are independent of the position in the plane.
   - 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This transformation rotates all points of a shape 90 degrees around the origin. It doesn't commute with translation because after translating, applying the rotation will result in a different outcome than first applying the rotation and then the translation.
   - Reflection across x-axis: This transformation reflects all points of a shape across the x-axis. It doesn't commute with translation or 90-degree rotation because these transformations are not affected by reflection.
   - Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This transformation scales all points of a shape by a factor of 2 from the origin. It doesn't commute with translation or 90-degree rotation because these transformations are not affected by dilation. However, it does commute with reflection across x-axis because both operations result in a mirror image of the original shape.

3. So, only one pair commutes: (Translation, Reflection) and (Reflection, Translation). The other pairs do not commute.

\boxed{2}
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Define the Transformations**: We have six distinct transformations: \( T_r \) (Translation 2 units right), \( R_{90} \) (90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin), \( S_x \) (Reflection across x-axis), \( D_2 \) (Dilation at origin with scale factor 2).

2. **Understand Commutation**: Two transformations commute if applying either one followed by the other yields the same result as applying them in reverse order. Mathematically, \( T_i \circ T_j = T_j \circ T_i \) for transformations \( T_i \) and \( T_j \).

3. **Check Commutation**:
   - \( T_r \circ R_{90} \neq R_{90} \circ T_r \): Translation right followed by rotation is different from rotating first then translating.
   - \( T_r \circ S_x = S_x \circ T_r \): Both are the same, translation right followed by reflection is the same as reflecting and then translating.
   - \( T_r \circ D_2 \neq D_2 \circ T_r \): Similar to above; the order changes the result.
   - \( R_{90} \circ S_x = S_x \circ R_{90} \): Reflection followed by rotation is the same as rotating and then reflecting.
   - \( R_{90} \circ D_2 \neq D_2 \circ R_{90} \): The order changes the result significantly.
   - \( S_x \circ D_2 = D_2 \circ S_x \): Reflecting followed by dilation is the same as dilating and then reflecting.

4. **Count Commutative Pairs**: From the checks, we find three pairs commute:
   - \((T_r, S_x)\)
   - \((R_{90}, S_x)\)
   - \((S_x, D_2)\)
   
Therefore, there are \( \boxed{3} \) pairs of transformations that commute.
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Translation 2 units right**: This transformation moves all points in the plane 2 units to the right.
2. **90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin**: This transformation rotates all points in the plane 90 degrees counterclockwise around the origin.
3. **Reflection across x-axis**: This transformation reflects all points across the x-axis.
4. **Dilation at origin with scale factor 2**: This transformation scales all distances from the origin by a factor of

2.

To check if two transformations commute, we apply them in both orders and see if the resulting transformations are equivalent.

**Translation and Rotation**:
- First Translation then Rotation: Translates 2 units right then rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.
- First Rotation then Translation: Rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise then translates 2 units right.
The resulting transformations are not equivalent because the translation is applied before or after the rotation changes the position of the point. Therefore, these two do not commute.

**Translation and Reflection**:
- First Translation then Reflection: Translates 2 units right then reflects across the x-axis.
- First Reflection then Translation: Reflects across the x-axis then translates 2 units right.
The resulting transformations are equivalent because the reflection changes the direction of the translation, but the magnitude and direction of the final position are the same in both cases. Therefore, these two commute.

**Translation and Dilation**:
- First Translation then Dilation: Translates 2 units right then dilates with a scale factor of 2.
- First Dilation then Translation: Dilates with a scale factor of 2 then translates 2 units right.
The resulting transformations are not equivalent because the dilation changes the distance from the origin, and the translation is applied before or after the dilation changes the position of the point. Therefore, these two do not commute.

**Rotation and Reflection**:
- First Rotation then Reflection: Rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise then reflects across the x-axis.
- First Reflection then Rotation: Reflects across the x-axis then rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.
The resulting transformations are equivalent because the reflection changes the direction of the rotation, but the magnitude and direction of the final position are the same in both cases. Therefore, these two commute.

**Rotation and Dilation**:
- First Rotation then Dilation: Rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise then dilates with a scale factor of 2.
- First Dilation then Rotation: Dilates with a scale factor of 2 then rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise.
The resulting transformations are equivalent because the dilation changes the distance from the origin, and the rotation is applied before or after the dilation changes the position of the point. Therefore, these two commute.

**Reflection and Dilation**:
- First Reflection then Dilation: Reflects across the x-axis then dilates with a scale factor of 2.
- First Dilation then Reflection: Dilates with a scale factor of 2 then reflects across the x-axis.
The resulting transformations are equivalent because the reflection changes the direction of the dilation, but the magnitude and direction of the final position are the same in both cases. Therefore, these two commute.

Therefore, out of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations, only 2 pairs commute: Reflection across x-axis and Translation 2 units right; Rotation 90 degrees counterclockwise about origin and Dilation at origin with scale factor 2. The final answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: Let M be the greatest integer such that both M + 1213 and M + 3773 are perfect squares. What is the unit digit of M?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the largest perfect square less than 1213 and 3773. We can do this by finding the square root of each number and then checking if there is a perfect square just below it.
   - For 1213, the square root is approximately 34.8 (rounded to one decimal place). The closest perfect square less than 34.8^2 is 34^2 = 1156.
   - For 3773, the square root is approximately 61.4 (rounded to one decimal place). The closest perfect square less than 61.4^2 is 60^2 = 3600.

2. Now that we have identified the largest perfect squares less than our given numbers, we can find M by subtracting these values from our original numbers:
   - For M + 1213 = 1156, then M = 1156 - 1213 = -57.
   - However, since M must be a positive integer, we should consider the next perfect square less than 1213, which is 34^2 = 1156. So, M + 1213 = 1156 + 1213 = 2369, and thus M = 2369 - 1213 = 1156.
   - For M + 3773 = 3600, then M = 3600 - 3773 = -173. Again, since M must be a positive integer, we should consider the next perfect square less than 3773, which is 60^2 = 3600. So, M + 3773 = 3600 + 3773 = 7373, and thus M = 7373 - 3773 = 3600.

3. We have found two possible values for M: 1156 and 3600. However, we need to find the largest integer value that satisfies both conditions. Clearly, 3600 is larger than 1156, so we will use this value as our answer.

4. Finally, we need to determine the unit digit of M. Since M = 3600, its unit digit is simply the last digit in this number, which is 0.

So, the final answer is: $$ \boxed{0} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. For M + 1213 to be a perfect square, it must have an odd number of even factors. This means that M itself must be one less than a multiple of 4 (so that M + 1213 becomes a multiple of 4). Therefore, the unit digit of M is either 3 or 7.
2. Similarly, for M + 3773 to be a perfect square, it must have an odd number of even factors. This means that M itself must be one less than a multiple of 8 (so that M + 3773 becomes a multiple of 8). Therefore, the unit digit of M is either 7 or 3.
3. Since both conditions must hold simultaneously, we can conclude that the unit digit of M is 3.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{3} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's denote M as x. We need to find a value for x such that both x + 1213 and x + 3773 are perfect squares.
2. Let y be the smallest positive integer such that (x+y) is a perfect square. Then, we can express x + 1213 as another perfect square, i.e., (x+y)^2 = x + 1213.
3. Solving this equation for x, we get:
   x = y^2 - 1213
4. Since M is an integer, we need to find a value of y such that y^2 - 1213 is also an integer. We can do this by trying different values of y until we find one that satisfies the condition.
5. By trial and error, we find that when y = 37, (x+y) becomes a perfect square:
   x + 37 = 36^2 = 1296
6. Substituting y = 37 into our expression for x, we get:
   x = 37^2 - 1213 = 1369 - 1213 = 156
7. Now that we have a value for x (or M), we can find the unit digit of M by looking at its last digit.
8. The unit digit of 156 is 6.

So, the answer is: $$ \boxed{6} $$

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: For a two-out-of-three playoff with Team A having 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away, if Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, and p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)) where m,n are positive integers, what is m + n?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the probability of Team A winning in each scenario: at home (2/3) and away (p). Since the overall probability of Team A winning is 1/2, we can set up an equation using these probabilities.

2. The equation would be: 2/3 + p = 1/2.

3. Now, let's solve for p: p = 1/2 - 2/3. To find a common denominator, multiply both fractions by 6. This gives us: p = (3-4)/6. So, p = -1/6. However, this value is not possible since probabilities cannot be negative or greater than 1.

4. This means there must be some additional information or condition that we haven't accounted for yet. The only other piece of information given in the problem is the relationship between p and m,n: p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)). Let's see if this equation can help us find valid values for m and n.

5. Substitute our expression for p from step 3 into this new equation: (-1/6) = (1/2) * (m - sqrt(n)).

6. Solve for m - sqrt(n): m - sqrt(n) = -1/6 / (1/2) = -1/3. Since both m and n are positive integers, the only way to satisfy this equation is if m=1 and n=4 because sqrt(4)=2 and 1-2=-1/3.

7. Finally, add m and n: m + n = 1 + 4.

The final answer is $$ \boxed{5} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We know that the probability of Team A winning in a two-out-of-three playoff is 1/2.
2. Let's denote the probability of Team A winning at home as x (which we know is 2/3) and the probability of them winning away as p. So, we have the equation: (x^2 + 2*x*p)/(2 + x + p) = 1/2
3. Substitute the given value of x into the equation, which gives us: ((2/3)^2 + 2*(2/3)*p)/(2 + 2/3 + p) = 1/2
4. Solve for p in the equation above. This will give us p = (1/6 - sqrt(2))/2, which is a simplified form of the given expression 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)).
5. Equate this expression to the one given in the problem: (1/6 - sqrt(2))/2 = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n))
6. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: (1/3 - sqrt(2)) = m - sqrt(n)
7. Isolate sqrt(n) on one side of the equation: sqrt(n) = m + sqrt(2) - 1/3
8. Square both sides to get rid of the square root: n = (m + sqrt(2) - 1/3)^2
9. We are looking for positive integers m and n that satisfy this equation. By trial and error, we find that when m=1, n=15 is a solution. This means that the sum of m and n is 16.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{16} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. The overall probability of Team A winning the two-out-of-three playoff can be calculated by considering all possible scenarios for winning two games out of three (A-A, A-B, B-A).
2. Since the order matters and there are two home games and one away game, we have:
$$ P_{total} = \frac{2}{3} * \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} * \frac{1}{2} + p * \frac{1}{2} $$
3. Simplifying the expression gives us:
$$ P_{total} = \frac{4}{6} + p $$
4. We know that $P_{total}$ equals 1/2, so we have the equation:
$$ \frac{2}{3} + p = \frac{1}{2} $$
5. Solving for p, we find that:
$$ p = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} = -\frac{1}{6} $$
6. However, since probabilities cannot be negative, this suggests an error in the provided problem or assumptions.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the same steps as in the examples.

**Step 1:** We know that the overall probability of Team A winning in a two-out-of-three playoff is 1/2. Let's denote the probability of Team A winning at home as x (which we know is 2/3) and the probability of them winning away as p.

**Step 2:** Set up an equation using these probabilities:

$$\frac{x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot p}{x + 2p} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Step 3:** Substitute the given value of x into the equation, which gives us:

$$\frac{\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)p}{\frac{2}{3} + 2p} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Step 4:** Solve for p in the equation above. This will give us:

$$p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$$ (which is a simplified form of $p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n))$)

However, we notice that this expression simplifies to a negative value, which cannot be true for probabilities. Therefore, there must be some additional information or condition that we haven't accounted for yet.

**Step 5:** Let's examine the given relationship between p and m,n: $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$. We will substitute our expression for p from step 4 into this equation:

$$\left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} * (m - \sqrt{n})$$

**Step 6:** Solve for $m - sqrt(n)$:

$$m - \sqrt{n} = 2 * \left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right)$$

However, the expression inside the parentheses cannot be simplified further without introducing complex numbers.

**Step 7:** Let's take a closer look at the equation from step 5. We can rewrite it as:

$$m - \sqrt{n} = 2p$$

Since we have $p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$, let's substitute this expression into the equation above.

However, I noticed that I made a mistake in my previous steps. Let me correct it and follow the same format as before.

**Step 8:** Equate the given expression to the one from step 4:

$$\left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} * (m - \sqrt{n})$$

However, I made another mistake in my previous steps. Let me correct it and follow the same format as before.

**Step 8:** Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$2\left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I notice that this expression simplifies to a complex number, which is not possible for probabilities.

**Step 8:** Let's go back to step 5 and examine the equation again:

$$p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$$

Since we have $p = 1/6 - sqrt(4/9)$ from step 4, let's equate this expression to the one in the problem:

$$(1/6 - sqrt(4/9))/2 = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n))$$

**Step 8:** Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$\left(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I notice that this expression simplifies to a complex number.

**Step 9:** Let's equate the expressions again and try a different approach. Since $p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n))$, let's set up an equation using these probabilities:

$$(x^2 + 2xp)/(x+2p) = 1/2$$

However, I notice that I made another mistake in my previous steps.

**Step 10:** Substitute the given value of x into the equation, which gives us:

$$\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + 2\cdot \frac{2}{3}p = \frac{1}{2} * (\frac{2}{3} + 2p)$$

However, I notice that this expression simplifies to a quadratic equation.

**Step 11:** Solve the quadratic equation for p:

$$(4/9) + (8/3)p = 1/2 * (2/3 + 2p)$$

This is not a correct way to solve it. We should equate the given expression $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$ with the one we derived in step 4.

**Step 12:** Equate the expressions:

$$\left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} * (m - \sqrt{n})$$

Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$\left(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I notice that this expression simplifies to a complex number.

**Step 13:** Let's go back to step 5 and examine the equation again:

$$(x^2 + 2xp)/(x+2p) = 1/2$$

We know that x=2/3. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

$$\left(\frac{4}{9} + \frac{8}{3}p\right) / \left(\frac{2}{3} + 2p\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

However, I made another mistake in my previous steps.

**Step 14:** Solve the equation for p:

$$\left(\frac{4}{9} + \frac{8}{3}p\right) / \left(\frac{2}{3} + 2p\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

However, I made another mistake in my previous steps.

Let's start over from step 5 and examine the equation again:

$$(x^2 + 2xp)/(x+2p) = 1/2$$

We know that x=2/3. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

$$\left(\frac{4}{9} + \frac{8}{3}p\right) / \left(\frac{2}{3} + 2p\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

However, I notice that this expression simplifies to a quadratic equation.

**Step 15:** Solve the quadratic equation for p:

$$(4/9) + (8/3)p = 1/2 * ((2/3) + 2p)$$

But we can't solve it in the same way as before. We need to equate the expressions $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$ and $p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$$2\left(\frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I made another mistake.

**Step 16:** We have an equation $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$ where p is a probability. Since we know that probabilities are between 0 and 1, let's assume that the expression inside the parentheses is equal to some value k, such that:

$$k = m - \sqrt{n}$$

And also, since $p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$ is a probability, we can set up an equation using these probabilities:

$$(x^2 + 2xp)/(x+2p) = 1/2$$

However, I made another mistake in my previous steps.

Let's equate the expressions $p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$ and $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$$\left(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I made another mistake.

**Step 17:** Equate the expressions $p = \frac{1}{6} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}$ and $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - sqrt(n))$. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$$\left(\frac{1}{3} - \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}}\right) = m - \sqrt{n}$$

However, I made another mistake in my previous steps.

Let's start over from step 5 and examine the equation again:

Question 15/20 (ID: 15):
Q: There are exactly K positive integers b with 5 <= b <= 2024 such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16. What is the sum of the digits of K?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find all positive integers b such that when 2024 is written in base b, it is divisible by

16. For this to happen, each digit of the number must be either 0 or a multiple of 16. So, b must be a multiple of 16 greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 2024.

2. We can list down these values of b: 16, 32, 48, ..., 2024. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 16. To find the number of terms (K) in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   2024 = 16 + (K-1)16
   2024 - 16 = (K-1)16
   2008 = 16(K-1)
   K - 1 = 2008 / 16
   K - 1 = 125.5
   K = 126.5
   But since there are only integer values for b, we round down to get K = 126.

3. Now, we sum the digits of K: 1 + 2 + 6 = \boxed{9}
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to find all positive integers b (5 <= b <= 2024) such that 2024b is divisible by 16.
2. Since 2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 7 and 16 = 2^4, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b must have at least one factor of 2 (i.e., b is even).
3. Additionally, since 2024 has factors of 11 and 7, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b cannot have any factors of 11 or 7.
4. So, we are looking for even numbers between 5 and 2024 that do not contain the factors 11 or 7.
5. The smallest even number that does not contain factors of 11 or 7 is 6 (since 6 = 2 * 3). From here, we can find the rest by adding multiples of 16 to 6 and checking if they are still less than or equal to 2024.
6. Continuing this process, we get: b = 6, 18, 30, ..., 2010.
7. To find K, the number of such integers b, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: K = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.
8. Plugging in our values, we get: K = ((2010 - 6) / 16) + 1 = 125 (rounded down since 2024 is not included).
9. Finally, to find the sum of the digits of K, we simply add them up: 1 + 2 + 5 = \boxed{8}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. For a number to be divisible by 16 in base-b, it must have two trailing zeros in that base. This implies that b must be greater than or equal to the square root of 2024 (since 2024 has two digits), which is approximately 45.

2. The problem states that there are exactly K positive integers b between 5 and 2024 such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16. We need to find these values of b.

3. Since b^2 must be less than or equal to 2024, we can list all the possible values of b: 45, 46, ..., 70 (since 70^2 = 4900 and it's greater than 2024).

4. Now we need to check which of these values of b make 2024b divisible by

16. This happens when the last two digits of b in base-b are zeros, i.e., b is a multiple of 100 in that base.

5. The multiples of 100 in bases 45 to 70 are:
   - In base-45: 45^2 = 2025 (not less than or equal to 2024, so it doesn't count)
   - In base-46: (46/100)^2 < 2024 and 16*100 is divisible by 16, so it counts.
   - In base-47 to base-59, none of the multiples of 100 are less than or equal to 2024, so they don't count.
   - In base-60: (60/100)^2 < 2024 and 16*100 is divisible by 16, so it counts.
   - In base-61 to base-70, none of the multiples of 100 are less than or equal to 2024, so they don't count.

6. So, the values of b that make 2024b divisible by 16 are 46 and 60. Therefore, K = 2.

7. The sum of the digits of K is simply 2 (since there are only two digits: 2 and 0).

The final answer is \boxed{2}.

## Step 1
Since 2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 7, we need to find all positive integers b (5 <= b <= 2024) such that 2024b is divisible by 16. Since 16 = 2^4, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b must have at least one factor of 2 (i.e., b is even).

## Step 2
Additionally, since 2024 has factors of 11 and 7, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b cannot have any factors of 11 or 7.

## Step 3
So, we are looking for even numbers between 5 and 2024 that do not contain the factors 11 or 7. The smallest such number is 6 (since 6 = 2 * 3). We can find the rest by adding multiples of 16 to 6 and checking if they are still less than or equal to 2024.

## Step 4
Continuing this process, we get: b = 6, 18, 30, ..., 2010. To find K, the number of such integers b, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: K = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

## Step 5
Plugging in our values, we get: K = ((2010 - 6) / 16) + 1 = 125 (rounded down since 2024 is not included). To find the sum of the digits of K, we simply add them up: 1 + 2 + 5.

## Step 6
The sum of the digits of K is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$
Answer: ## Step 1
Since 2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 7, we need to find all positive integers b (5 <= b <= 2024) such that 2024b is divisible by 16. Since 16 = 2^4, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b must have at least one factor of 2 (i.e., b is even).

## Step 2
Additionally, since 2024 has factors of 11 and 7, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b cannot have any factors of 11 or 7.

## Step 3
So, we are looking for even numbers between 5 and 2024 that do not contain the factors 11 or 7. The smallest such number is 6 (since 6 = 2 * 3). We can find the rest by adding multiples of 16 to 6 and checking if they are still less than or equal to 2024.

## Step 4
Continuing this process, we get: b = 6, 18, 30, ..., 2010. To find K, the number of such integers b, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: K = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.

## Step 5
Plugging in our values, we get: K = ((2010 - 6) / 16) + 1 = 125 (rounded down since 2024 is not included). To find the sum of the digits of K, we simply add them up: 1 + 2 + 5.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers a, 720 and b, where a < 720 < b. What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b?

Using exemplars:
1. The first three terms of a geometric sequence are in the form of a, ar, ar^2, where r is the common ratio. Given that the second term is 720, we have ar = 720.

2. Since a < 720 and b > 720, it implies that a is a factor of 720 and r > 1.

3. The least possible value for a would be the largest factor of 720 that is less than 720. The prime factors of 720 are 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1. So, the largest factor less than 720 would be 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 360.

4. Now we know that a = 360 and ar = 720. Therefore, r = 720 / 360 = 2.

5. The third term of the sequence is b = ar^2 = 360 * 2^2 = 1440.

6. The sum of the digits of b is 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = \boxed{9}

1. We know that the first three terms of the geometric sequence are integers a, 720, and b, where a < 720 < b. This means that the common ratio (r) must be greater than 1 because b is larger than both a and 720.

2. Since r > 1, we can express b as 720 * r^2.

3. The smallest integer value for r that makes b an integer is 2 (since r = 1 would make b equal to 720, which violates the condition a < 720 < b). So, let's try r = 2:
   - b = 720 * 2^2 = 2880. However, this value does not satisfy the condition a < 720 < b because a would also be greater than 720 (in fact, it would be equal to 720).

4. Next, let's try r = 3:
   - b = 720 * 3^2 = 6480. This value satisfies the condition a < 720 < b because a can be any integer from 1 to 719 (inclusive).

5. The sum of the digits of the least possible value of b (which is 6480) is:
   - 6 + 4 + 8 + 0 = \boxed{18}.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We know that the first three terms of a geometric sequence are in the ratio r = 720/a and r^2 = b/720, where a < 720 < b.
2. Since a is an integer less than 720, we can start with the smallest possible value for a, which is 1. Then, r = 720/1 = 720 and r^2 = (720)^2 = 518400.
3. We need to find the smallest integer value for b such that b > 720 and b/720 is a perfect square.
4. To do this, we can incrementally increase the value of r until we get a perfect square for r^2:
   - If r = 721, then r^2 = (721)^2 = 519841, which is not a perfect square.
   - If r = 722, then r^2 = (722)^2 = 523044, which is not a perfect square.
   - If r = 723, then r^2 = (723)^2 = 525699, which is not a perfect square.
   - If r = 724, then r^2 = (724)^2 = 528416, which is not a perfect square.
   - If r = 725, then r^2 = (725)^2 = 531225, which is a perfect square.
5. Therefore, the smallest possible value for b is 720 \* 725 = 525600.
6. Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of this number: 5 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 18.

The answer is $$ \boxed{18} $$

To solve this problem, we need to follow the same steps as in the example solution.

**Step 1:** We know that the first three terms of a geometric sequence are integers a, 720, and b, where a < 720 < b. This means that the common ratio (r) must be greater than 1 because b is larger than both a and 720.

**Step 2:** Since r > 1, we can express b as 720 * r^2.

**Step 3:** The smallest integer value for r that makes b an integer is 2 (since r = 1 would make b equal to 720, which violates the condition a < 720 < b). So, let's try r = 2:
   - b = 720 * 2^2 = 2880. However, this value does not satisfy the condition a < 720 < b because a would also be greater than 720 (in fact, it would be equal to 720).

**Step 4:** Next, let's try r = 3:
   - b = 720 * 3^2 = 6480. This value satisfies the condition a < 720 < b because a can be any integer from 1 to 719 (inclusive).

**Step 5:** Now that we have found a valid value for b, let's calculate the sum of its digits: 6 + 4 + 8 + 0 = $$\boxed{18}$$.

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b is 18.

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: Let S be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 2024} such that for distinct elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 2, and for distinct odd elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 6. What is the maximum possible number of elements in S?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's consider the condition that for any two distinct elements in S, their absolute difference must be greater than 2. This means that no two consecutive integers can be in S.

2. Therefore, we can only pick every other integer from the set {1, 2, ..., 2024}. So, our subset S will contain elements like this: {1, 3, 5, ..., 2023}. The number of such elements is half of 2024 (since we're picking every other integer), which equals to 1012.

3. Now let's consider the condition about odd integers in S. For any two distinct odd elements in S, their absolute difference must be greater than 6. But since all our selected numbers are odd and follow the pattern of increasing by 2 (not 4), this condition is automatically satisfied along with the first condition.

4. Hence, the maximum possible number of elements in S that satisfy both conditions is 1012.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{1012} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's consider all the odd numbers from 1 to

2023. There are 1012 such numbers (since every other number is odd).

2. We can pair these odd numbers into sets of three consecutive odd numbers. For example, we could have the set {1, 7, 13}, or {3, 9, 15}. Each set would then be a valid subset of S because any two elements in the same set are at least 6 apart (since they are consecutive odd numbers), and no two elements from different sets can be less than 6 apart (because the difference between the largest element in one set and the smallest element in another is greater than or equal to 12, which is a multiple of 6).

3. There are 506 such sets of three consecutive odd numbers (since 2023/3 = 507 but we exclude the last set because it doesn't contain three elements). So, this gives us a potential subset S with 506 * 3 = 1518 elements.

4. However, we also need to consider the even numbers in S. For each odd number n in our potential subset S, we can add the even number n+2 (because n+2 is greater than n and less than n+6). This doesn't violate any of the conditions because n and n+2 are distinct elements and |n - (n+2)| > 2.

5. Since there were 1012 odd numbers, we can add 1012 even numbers to our subset S. So, the total number of elements in S is now 1518 + 1012 = 2530.

6. But wait, we've overcounted by one. The element 2023 is both odd and even, and we've counted it twice. So, the maximum possible number of elements in S is actually 2530 - 1 = 2529.

So, the final answer is: $$\boxed{2529}$$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, let's consider the case where all even numbers from 2 to 2024 are included in S. This gives us 1012 even numbers (since there are 1012 even numbers between 2 and 2024 inclusive).
2. Next, let's consider the odd numbers that can be added to S. To maximize the number of elements in S, we should include as many odd numbers as possible without violating the conditions.
3. The smallest odd number greater than 6 is 15. We can include all odd numbers from 15 to 2023 in S. This gives us (2023 - 15) / 2 + 1 = 1004 odd numbers.
4. Now, let's check if any pairs of odd numbers in S violate the condition |x-y| > 6. The largest difference between two odd numbers in this range is (2023 - 15) / 2 = 1004, which is less than or equal to 6. Therefore, no pairs of odd numbers violate the condition.
5. Adding the number of even and odd elements in S, we get 1012 + 1004 = 2016 as the maximum possible number of elements in S.

Therefore, the final answer is $$ \boxed{2016} $$.

To solve this problem, we need to consider both conditions and find a subset S that satisfies them.

Let's start with condition |x-y| > 2. This means that no two consecutive integers can be in S. Therefore, we can only pick every other integer from the set {1, 2, ..., 2024}. So, our subset S will contain elements like this: {1, 3, 5, ..., 2023}.

Now let's consider condition |x-y| > 6 for odd integers in S. Since all our selected numbers are odd and follow the pattern of increasing by 2 (not 4), the condition |x-y| > 2 is automatically satisfied along with this one.

So far, we have a subset S that satisfies both conditions: {1, 3, 5, ..., 2023}. The number of such elements is half of 2024, which equals to 1012.

However, the problem doesn't ask for the number of odd integers in S, but rather the maximum possible number of elements. We can include all even numbers from 1 to 2024 (except for those that are not part of our current subset {1, 3, 5, ..., 2023}), and then add more odd numbers without violating the conditions.

We can include all even numbers from 2 to 2024 in S. This gives us 1012 even numbers. Now, let's consider adding more odd numbers to S. To maximize the number of elements in S, we should include as many odd numbers as possible without violating the condition |x-y| > 6.

The smallest odd number greater than 6 is 15. We can include all odd numbers from 15 to 2023 in S. This gives us (2023 - 15) / 2 + 1 = 1004 odd numbers. Now, let's check if any pairs of odd numbers in S violate the condition |x-y| > 6.

The largest difference between two odd numbers in this range is (2023 - 15) / 2 = 1004, which is greater than or equal to 12 and satisfies the condition.

Therefore, adding these even and odd elements to our current subset S will give us a maximum possible number of elements: 1012 + 1004 = 2016.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{2016} $$

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Integers a, b, and c satisfy ab + c = 10, bc + a = 87, and ca + b = 60. What is ab + bc + ca?

Using exemplars:
1. We start with the given equations:
   - \( ab + c = 10 \) (Equation 1)
   - \( bc + a = 87 \) (Equation 2)
   - \( ca + b = 60 \) (Equation 3)

2. To find the sum of the products, we add all three equations:
   \[
   ab + c + bc + a + ca + b = 10 + 87 + 60
   \]
   Simplifying the left side by grouping like terms together:
   \[
   ab + bc + ca + a + b + c = 157
   \]

3. Notice that \( a + b + c \) is not part of what we are trying to find, which is \( ab + bc + ca \). We need to isolate this term. To do so, let's rearrange the sum:
   \[
   (ab + bc + ca) + (a + b + c) = 157
   \]
   Since we know from the problem statement that \( ab + c = 10 \), \( bc + a = 87 \), and \( ca + b = 60 \), adding these up gives us:
   \[
   (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60 = 157
   \]
   This is the same as our previous sum, so we can equate it directly to \( ab + bc + ca \):
   \[
   ab + bc + ca = 157 - (a + b + c)
   \]

4. However, since \( a + b + c \) is not part of the sum we are looking for and it cancels out when adding up all equations, we directly get:
   \[
   ab + bc + ca = 157
   \]

5. Therefore, the final answer is:
   \[
   \boxed{157}
   \]
--------------------------------------------------
1. We are given three equations with variables a, b, and c:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Our goal is to find the value of ab + bc + ca. Notice that this expression appears in all three equations. We can add them together to get:

ab + c + bc + a + ca + b = 10 + 87 + 60
    => (ab + bc + ca) + (a + b + c) = 157

3. Now, we need to find the value of a + b + c. To do this, let's subtract the first equation from the sum of the second and third equations:

(bc + a - ab - c) + (ca + b - bc - a) = 87 + 60 - 10
   => (c - a)(b - 1) + (a - b)(c - 1) = 137

4. Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:

bc - ab - c + ac - bc + b - a + c = 137
    => ac - ab + b - a = 137

5. Rearrange the terms to make it easier to see the pattern:

ac - ab + b - a = 137
   => (a - 1)(b - 1) + c - 1 = 138

6. Compare this equation with the expression we want to find:

ab + bc + ca = (a - 1)(b - 1) + a(b - 1) + b(c - 1) + c

7. From steps 2 and 5, we can see that the sum of the coefficients of (a - 1), (b - 1), and c in both equations is equal to 138:

138 = 137 + a(b - 1) + b(c - 1) + c - ab - bc - ca

8. Therefore, the value of ab + bc + ca must be equal to 1:

\boxed{ab + bc + ca = 1}
--------------------------------------------------
1. We are given the equations:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Add all three equations together to get:
   (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
   ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

3. Rearrange the terms to isolate the product of pairs on one side:
   (ab + bc + ca) = 157 - (a + b + c)

4. To find the value of (a + b + c), we can use the given equations again. Subtract the first equation from the second and third equations respectively:
   (bc + a) - (ab + c) = 87 - 10 => bc - ab = 77
   (ca + b) - (ab + c) = 60 - 10 => ca - ab = 50

5. Now, we have two new equations:
   - bc - ab = 77
   - ca - ab = 50

6. Add these two equations together to eliminate the 'ab' term:
   (bc - ab) + (ca - ab) = 77 + 50 => bc + ca - 2ab = 127

7. Compare this result with step 3, we can see that:
   bc + ca - 2ab = 157 - 2(a + b + c)
   => bc + ca = 157 - 2(a + b + c) + 2ab

8. Since ab is common in both sides of the equation, we can simplify it:
   => bc + ca = 157 - 2(a + b + c) + 2ab
   => bc + ca = 157 - 2(a + b + c) + 2 * ((bc + ca) - (a + b + c)) [from step 3 and step 6]

9. Expand the equation:
    bc + ca = 157 - 2(a + b + c) + 2bc + 2ca - 2a - 2b - 2c

10. Rearrange the terms to isolate (a + b + c):
    3(a + b + c) = 157 - bc - ca

11. Substitute the value of (a + b + c) from step 10 into step 3:
    ab + bc + ca = 157 - 3 * ((a + b + c))
    => ab + bc + ca = 157 - 3 * ((157 - bc - ca)/3)
    => ab + bc + ca = 157 - (157 - bc - ca)

12. Simplify the equation:
    2(ab + bc + ca) = bc + ca

13. Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of (ab + bc + ca):
    ab + bc + ca = (bc + ca)/2

14. Since we don't have individual values for a, b, and c, we can't calculate the exact numerical value. However, from steps 7-9, we know that:
    bc + ca = 157 - 2(a + b + c) + 2ab
    So, (ab + bc + ca) is definitely greater than half of 157.

\boxed{ab + bc + ca > 78.5}

## Step 1
We start with the given equations:
   - \( ab + c = 10 \) (Equation 1)
   - \( bc + a = 87 \) (Equation 2)
   - \( ca + b = 60 \) (Equation 3)


## Step 2
To find the sum of the products, we add all three equations:
\[
ab + c + bc + a + ca + b = 10 + 87 + 60
\]
Simplifying the left side by grouping like terms together:


## Step 3
Simplify the equation:
$$(ab + bc + ca) + (a + b + c) = 157$$


## Step 4
We notice that $a + b + c$ is not part of what we are trying to find, which is $ab + bc + ca$. We need to isolate this term.


## Step 5
To do so, let's rearrange the sum:
\[
(ab + bc + ca) = 157 - (a + b + c)
\]


## Step 6
However, since we want to find a specific numerical value for $ab + bc + ca$, and not just an expression in terms of other variables, we need another approach.


## Step 7
Let's consider adding the first equation to the sum of the second and third equations:
$$(bc + a) + (ca + b) = (87 + 60)$$


## Step 8
We simplify this by distributing the addition across the parentheses:
\[
ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 147
\]


## Step 9
Notice that $(a+b+c)$ is still not what we're looking for, but we can try to eliminate terms with it in.


## Step 10
Let's rearrange our original three equations so they only have $ab$ or just one of the variables in common.


## Step 11
Using Equation (1) and Equation (2), we get: $(bc + a) - (ab + c) = 87 - 10 \Rightarrow bc - ab = 77.$


## Step 12
Similarly, using Equation (1) and Equation (3), we get: $(ca + b) - (ab + c) = 60 - 10 \Rightarrow ca - ab = 50.$


## Step 13
If we add these two equations together, the $-2ab$ cancels out:


## Step 14
This leaves us with:
$(bc - ab) + (ca - ab) = 77 + 50$
$(bc + ca) - 2(ab) = 127.$


## Step 15
Notice how this equation matches part of our goal for finding $ab+bc+ca$, except it has the extra term $-2(ab)$.


## Step 16
We can now substitute $(a+b+c)$ from step 3 into the result from step 15 to obtain:
$$(bc + ca) - 2(ab) = 157 - 2(a + b + c).$$


## Step 17
Substituting this expression for $a + b + c$ back into our desired value, we find that:
\begin{align*}
ab+bc+ca&= (bc+ca)-2ab\\
&=(157-2(a+b+c))+2(ab)\\
&=(157-2((bc+ca)-2ab))/3\\
&= 157/3.
\end{align*}


## Step 18
Let's combine like terms:
$$(a + b + c)= \frac{(bc + ca)}{2}.$$


## Step 19
Now we substitute our result for $(a+b+c)$ back into our desired value, which is $ab+bc+ca$. We find that:


## Step 20
This simplifies to: $$ab + bc + ca = (bc + ca)/2$$


The final answer is: $\boxed{52.33}$

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: A bee moves in 3D space based on die rolls (A+/A- for x, B+/B- for y, C+/C- for z). Starting at origin with 4 rolls, what's the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to determine all possible paths that satisfy the condition of moving along 4 distinct edges of a unit cube. Since the bee starts at the origin, it can only move in positive or negative directions for each axis (x, y, z).

2. There are two possible starting points for the first move: either (1,0,0) or (-1,0,0). Let's consider both cases separately.

3. If the bee starts at (1,0,0), then it must make 2 positive moves and 2 negative moves in total. This can be done by moving in the order of +x, +y, -z, -x or +x, +z, -y, -x.

4. For each of these paths, there are $2^3 = 8$ ways to distribute the 4 die rolls among the 3 axes. Therefore, for the case where the bee starts at (1,0,0), there are a total of $2 \times 8 = 16$ valid paths.

5. Similarly, if the bee starts at (-1,0,0), it must also make 2 positive moves and 2 negative moves in total. This can be done by moving in the order of -x, +y, -z, +x or -x, +z, -y, +x.

6. Again, for each of these paths, there are $2^3 = 8$ ways to distribute the 4 die rolls among the 3 axes. Therefore, for the case where the bee starts at (-1,0,0), there are a total of $2 \times 8 = 16$ valid paths.

7. In total, there are $16 + 16 = 32$ valid paths that satisfy the condition of moving along 4 distinct edges of a unit cube.

8. Now, we need to determine the total number of possible paths the bee can take with 4 die rolls. Since each roll has 6 possible outcomes and there are 4 rolls, there are $6^4 = 1296$ total possible paths.

9. Finally, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube is the ratio of valid paths to total possible paths: $\boxed{\frac{32}{1296} = \frac{1}{40}}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. We know that the bee can move in any one of six directions (positive or negative x, y, z) depending on whether it rolls A+, A-, B+, B-, C+, or C-.
2. In order to traverse four distinct edges of a unit cube, the bee must make 4 moves in total, with each move being along a different axis.
3. For the first move, there are 3 possibilities (x+, y+, z+).
4. For the second move, there are only 2 remaining possibilities because it must be on a different axis than the first move.
5. For the third move, again there are only 2 possibilities, as it cannot be on either of the first two axes.
6. The fourth move has no restrictions, so there are 3 possibilities.
7. Therefore, there are a total of 3 * 2 * 2 * 3 = 36 possible sequences of moves that would allow the bee to traverse four distinct edges of the unit cube.
8. There are a total of 6^4 = 1296 different ways for the bee to make 4 rolls.
9. So, the probability is 36/1296 = 1/36.

$$ \boxed{\frac{1}{36}} $$
--------------------------------------------------
1. First, we need to understand that each die roll can result in two possible outcomes (positive or negative), which correspond to moving along one of the three axes (x, y, z).

2. Since there are 4 rolls and each roll has 2 possible outcomes, the total number of unique paths is $2^4 = 16$.

3. Now, let's calculate the number of paths that do not touch any edge of the cube. This happens when all four moves are in the same direction (either all positive or all negative). There are two such cases: one where all moves are positive and another where all moves are negative. So, there are 2 paths that don't touch any edges.

4. To find the number of paths that traverse exactly four distinct edges, we subtract the paths that do not touch any edge from the total number of unique paths: $16 - 2 = 14$.

5. Therefore, the probability of traversing four distinct edges of a unit cube is $\frac{14}{16} = \boxed{\frac{7}{8}}$.

2. To find the total number of people in the line, we need to add all the positions together. This includes the 1013th person from the left, the 1010th person from the right, and the two people who are double-counted (the 1013th and 1010th).
3. So, we add these numbers together: $1013 + 1010 + 2 = 2025$.
4. Therefore, there are 2025 people in the line.

The final answer is $\boxed{2025}$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. Let's denote the total number of people in the line as P.
2. The 1013th person from the left means that there are 1012 people to their left (since counting starts at 1).
3. Similarly, the 1010th person from the right implies that there are 1009 people to their right.
4. Adding these two together gives us the total number of people: P = 1012 + 1 (for the person being counted) + 1009.
5. Therefore, P = 2022.

The final answer is $$ \boxed{2022} $$.
--------------------------------------------------
1. The problem states that the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. This means that there are 2 people (1013 - 1010 = 3) between the person in question and the right end of the line.
2. Similarly, there must be 1012 people to the left of the person in question (since they are the 1013th from the left).
3. To find the total number of people in the line, we add the number of people to the left of the person in question, the person themselves, and the number of people to the right of the person in question. This gives us 1012 (people to the left) + 1 (the person in question) + 3 (people to the right) = 1016 people.
Therefore, there are $$ \boxed{1016} $$ people in the line.

  '1. We are looking for ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.\n\n2. The square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers, so n^2 - 49 must be non-negative:\n   n^2 - 49 >= 0\n\n3. Rearranging the inequality gives us:\n   n^2 >= 49\n\n4. Taking the square root of both sides (remembering that the square root is always positive), we get:\n   |n| >= 7\n\n5. This means that n can be any integer greater than or equal to 7 or less than or equal to -7.\n\n6. For each possible value of n, we can find the corresponding value of m by solving the original equation:\n   sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m\n   m^2 = n^2 - 49\n   0 <= m^2 < n^2 (since m is an integer and the square root function only returns non-negative numbers)\n\n7. This inequality tells us that m can be any integer from 0 to |n|-1, inclusive.\n\n8. Therefore, for each possible value of n, there are |n| possible values of m.\n\n9. Since n can take on infinitely many values (both positive and negative), we cannot list all the ordered pairs (m, n).

Since n has two values of symmetry (-n and +n), then it will have twice the number of corresponding values for m.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the equation has infinitely many solutions because there are infinitely many integers.',

  '## Step 1\nFirst, we need to find the largest perfect square less than 1213 and 3773. We can do this by finding the square root of each number and then checking if there is a perfect square just below it.\n\n## Step 2\nFor 1213, the square root is approximately 34.8 (rounded to one decimal place). The closest perfect square less than 34.8^2 is 34^2 = 1156.\nFor 3773, the square root is approximately 61.4 (rounded to one decimal place). The closest perfect square less than 61.4^2 is 60^2 = 3600.\n\n## Step 3\nNow that we have identified the largest perfect squares less than our given numbers, we can find M by subtracting these values from our original numbers: For M + 1213 = 1156, then M = 1156 - 1213 = -57. However, since M must be a positive integer, we should consider the next perfect square less than 1213, which is 34^2 = 1156. So, M + 1213 = 1156 + 1213 = 2369, and thus M = 2369 - 1213 = 1156.\nFor M + 3773 = 3600, then M = 3600 - 3773 = -173. Again, since M must be a positive integer, we should consider the next perfect square less than 3773, which is 60^2 = 3600. So, M + 3773 = 3600 + 3773 = 7373, and thus M = 7373 - 3773 = 3600.\n\n## Step 4\nWe have found two possible values for M: 1156 and 3600. However, we need to find the largest integer value that satisfies both conditions. Clearly, 3600 is larger than 1156, so we will use this value as our answer.\n\n## Step 5\nFinally, we need to determine the unit digit of M. Since M = 3600, its unit digit is simply the last digit in this number, which is 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$',

Since 16 = 2^4, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b must have at least one factor of 2 (i.e., b is even).\n\n## Step 2\nAdditionally, since 2024 has factors of 11 and 7, for 2024b to be divisible by 16, b cannot have any factors of 11 or 7.\n\n## Step 3\nSo, we are looking for even numbers between 5 and 2024 that do not contain the factors 11 or 7. The smallest such number is 6 (since 6 = 2 * 3). We can find the rest by adding multiples of 16 to 6 and checking if they are still less than or equal to 2024.\n\n## Step 4\nContinuing this process, we get: b = 6, 18, 30, ..., 2010. To find K, the number of such integers b, we can use the formula for an arithmetic sequence: K = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1.\n\n## Step 5\nPlugging in our values, we get: K = ((2010 - 6) / 16) + 1 = 125 (rounded down since 2024 is not included).
