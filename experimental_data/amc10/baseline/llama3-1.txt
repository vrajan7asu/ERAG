Q1: ## Step 1: First, we need to compute 9901*101.
9901*101 = 999001.

## Step 2: Next, let's calculate 99*10101.
99*10101 = 9999999.

## Step 3: Now, subtract the second result from the first one.
999001 - 9999999 = -10009.

Q3: ## Step 1
To find the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes, we should first list out the prime numbers in ascending order and identify the ones that are small enough to be included in the sum.

## Step 2
Since we're looking for the smallest prime that meets this condition, we start by listing the first few primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. We can begin combining these numbers in every possible way, ensuring each combination only includes distinct prime numbers and always has a sum of 5 primes.

## Step 3
The smallest such sum is $2+3+5+7+11 = 28$. Since this sum is not a prime number, we continue with different combinations until we find one that gives us a prime number. Let’s try another combination: $2+3+5+7+13 = 30$.

## Step 4
Upon observing the results from step 3, it becomes clear that the numbers produced in this manner have been consistently even and greater than two; as such, they can't be considered prime numbers, since all primes are either the number one or odd.

## Step 5
At this point, we will attempt to add other distinct prime numbers until the sum is a prime. We could go ahead with $2+3+7+11+13 = 36$, but as before, it’s even and cannot be considered a prime number. So let's try using the next odd prime: $2+3+5+7+17$.

## Step 6
Calculating this sum yields $2+3+5+7+17=34$. As with previous results, we realize that our result is also even and cannot be considered a prime number. So now let’s try one more combination using the next odd prime after 17 which is 19.

## Step 7
The next attempt for creating the sum of distinct primes would be $2+3+5+11+13$. As before, our result is not a prime number as it is even.

## Step 8
Next we consider the combination $2+3+7+13+17$ and find that this is also not a prime number since it’s even.

## Step 9
We have tried several combinations so far without finding a sum of primes equal to another prime. The next step would be $2+5+11+13+17$. Upon calculating the sum, we get an even result which cannot be considered a prime.

## Step 10
Now let’s consider adding $3$ instead of $2$ in our previous attempt and see what happens when we do $3+5+7+11+13$. Our answer to this sum will not be a prime number as it is even. vs 7 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q4: ## Step 1: Understand that we are looking for the smallest number of two-digit integers that can add up to 2024.
The problem asks us to determine the minimum number of two-digit numbers required to achieve the sum of 2024.

## Step 2: First, let's see how large a single two-digit number can be. The largest two-digit number is 99.
We need to find the smallest set of two-digit numbers that add up to 2024.

## Step 3: We can start by finding out how many times 99 fits into 2024 and then calculate the remainder.
To find the minimum number of two-digit integers, we divide 2024 by 99. The quotient will tell us how many times 99 can be used as a term in our sum.

## Step 4: Calculate the quotient and remainder from the division.
Performing the division, we get $2024 \div 99 = 20$ with a remainder of 44. This means that we need at least 20 numbers of 99 to get close to 2024, and then we have a remainder.

## Step 5: The remainder indicates how much more we still need to reach the target sum.
We have already accounted for $20 \times 99 = 1980$ in our total. Now, we must use smaller two-digit numbers to make up the remaining amount of 44.

## Step 6: Calculate the smallest number of additional terms needed to cover the remainder.
Since each term is at least 10 (the smallest two-digit integer), and we have a remainder of 44, we will need fewer than five terms to cover this remainder because $5 \times 9 = 45$ which is more than our remainder.

## Step 7: The minimum number of two-digit numbers required to write the sum of 2024 is the sum of the quotient (20) and the number of additional terms needed to make up the remainder.
Therefore, we have a total of $20 + 4 = 24$ two-digit integers that can be used to achieve this sum.

Q5: ## Step 1
To find the smallest integer \(n\) for which \(n!\) is divisible by 2024, we first need to factorize 2024 into its prime factors.

## Step 2
The prime factorization of 2024 can be broken down as follows: $2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 23$

## Step 3
To ensure that \(n!\) is a multiple of 2024, it needs to contain the same prime factors in at least the same quantities. Thus, we need at least three factors of two, one factor of eleven, and one factor of twenty-three.

## Step 4
In finding n, we must remember that we do not count the number we seek itself. We have three factors of 2 from $2^3$, one factor of 11, and one factor of 23 in our prime factorization.

## Step 5
The smallest value of \(n\) that contains at least the necessary quantities of each prime factor is therefore \boxed{23}$.

Q6: ## Step 1
We first determine how many letters we have to swap. We want to go from $A B C D E F$ to $F E D C B A$. Since there are 6 letters and we need to move each one by three places, it will take at least $3$ swaps to do this.

## Step 2
After making these swaps, the string would be $\boxed{CBADEF}.$ We still need to swap the first two letters in order to get our desired string. Therefore, the total number of swaps is $\boxed{4}$.

Q7: ## Step 1: To find the least possible positive sum of three integers whose product is 60, we need to factorize 60 into its prime factors.
The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.

## Step 2: The product of three integers is given by $abc$, and we want to minimize their sum. To achieve this, it's helpful to express the product as a product of consecutive numbers because that would give us a smaller sum.
We can try expressing $60$ as $a(b)(c)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers.

## Step 3: Since we want to minimize the sum, we need to find three consecutive numbers whose product is $60$. However, it's not possible for any set of three consecutive numbers to multiply together to get a number as small as 60. Therefore, we must look for another method.
Looking at the prime factorization of $60$, we see that if we take two primes and their product is one of our integers, then we can make the third integer be the remaining prime.

## Step 4: Consider possible combinations of these prime factors to form three integers whose sum could potentially be minimized.
We have a few options for how to choose $a$, $b$, and $c$ given that we are trying to minimize their sum. We consider different choices such as $(2,3,5)$, $(1,4,15)$ or other combinations.

## Step 5: To calculate the least possible positive sum of the three integers among these options.
For each combination from step 4, let's calculate the corresponding sums to determine which one is smallest:
- Option 1: For $(2,3,5)$ the sum is $2+3+5=10$.
- Option 2: For $(1,4,15)$ the sum is $1+4+15=20$.

## Step 6: Choose the combination with the least sum among all options.
We need to consider if there are any other combinations that produce a smaller sum. Since we're looking for the smallest possible sum and have examined several potential combinations, it seems like $(2,3,5)$ is the optimal choice for minimizing the sum.

## Step 7: Conclude with the result from step 6.
Based on our analysis of different options for three integers whose product equals $60$, we see that $(2,3,5)$ yields a minimum sum of $\boxed{10}$.

Q9: ## Step 1: First, we need to select the members for the first team. We have 6 choices for the two juniors in the first team, which can be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
## Step 2: After selecting the two juniors, there are $4$ remaining juniors and $6$ seniors left to form the next two teams. We can choose the two seniors from this group of $6$ seniors, which can be done in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways.
## Step 3: At this point, we have selected all members for the first team and all but one junior for the second team. The remaining four individuals will form the third team.
## Step 4: Now, to find the total number of ways to select the teams, we need to consider that after selecting the two juniors for the first team, there are $\binom{6}{2}$ choices for the two seniors in that team and $\binom{4}{2}$ choices for the two seniors in the second team.
## Step 5: The number of ways to select members for the teams is then given by $\binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{8}{2}} \times \frac{\binom{6}{2}}{\binom{8}{2}} = 15 \times 6 \times \frac{6}{28} \times \frac{15}{28}$.
## Step 6: To find the final number of ways to form teams, we simplify the expression $\frac{(15 \times 6) \times (6 \times 15)}{28 \times 28}$.
## Step 7: Simplifying further gives us $(\frac{15}{14} \times \frac{6}{14}) \times (\frac{6}{14} \times \frac{15}{14}) = (\frac{90}{196}) \times (\frac{90}{196})$.
## Step 8: Multiplying the numerators and denominators gives us $\frac{(90)(90)}{(196)(196)}$.
## Step 9: Simplifying this fraction yields $\frac{8100}{38416}$.

Q10: ## Step 1
Since we are starting with $n=100$, the first step is to determine whether it is divisible by $3$ (in which case we replace $n$ by $\frac{n}{3}$) or not (in which case we replace $n$ by $n+10$).
For $n=100$, since it is a multiple of $3$, we need to replace it by the integer division $100 \div 3 = \lfloor \frac{100}{3} \rfloor = 33$.
Then, in the second step, we again check whether $\boxed{33}$ is divisible by $3$. Since it is not a multiple of $3$, we need to replace it by $n+10=43.$

Q11: ## Step 1: Analyze the given equation to understand what it's asking for.
We are given the equation $\sqrt{n^2 - 49} = m$. This means that we need to find all possible pairs of integers (m, n) such that the square root of $(n^2 - 49)$ equals $m$.

## Step 2: Solve the equation under the square root for $n$.
To find the values of $n$, we start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root. This gives us $n^2 - 49 = m^2$. Then, adding 49 to both sides yields $n^2 = m^2 + 49$. Now, taking the square root of both sides, we have $n = \pm\sqrt{m^2 + 49}$.

## Step 3: Identify all integer values for $m$ that result in integer solutions for $n$.
For $n$ to be an integer, the expression under the radical must be a perfect square. Thus, we can rewrite $\sqrt{m^2 + 49} = \sqrt{(m+7)^2}$ (or $\sqrt{(m-7)^2}$), which implies that $(m+7)$ and $(m-7)$ are both perfect squares.

## Step 4: Determine the possible pairs of integers $(m, n)$.
The only integer values for $m$ such that $(m+7)$ or $(m-7)$ is a perfect square are when $m = -7$, $0$, or $7$. This results in four ordered pairs of integers: $(-7,-7)$, $(0,-7)$, $(0,7)$, and $(7,7)$.

Q12: ## Step 1: Identify the given transformations
The given list includes six distinct transformations:
- Translation 2 units right
- 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin
- Reflection across x-axis
- Dilation at origin with scale factor 2

## Step 2: Understand what it means for two transformations to commute
For two transformations A and B to commute, the order in which we apply them must not change the result. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
AB = BA

## Step 3: Analyze the composition of each pair of transformations
To determine if any two transformations commute, let's analyze their compositions.
- Composition of translation with rotation
- Composition of translation with reflection
- Composition of translation with dilation
- Composition of rotation with reflection
- Composition of rotation with dilation
- Composition of reflection with dilation

## Step 4: Apply the composition rules for each pair of transformation types
Let T be translation, R be rotation, F be reflection, and D be dilation.
- For T and R (translation and rotation), order matters as TR ≠ RT because a rotation followed by a translation will result in a different outcome than when applying these operations in reverse order.
- For T and F (translation and reflection), the composition of TF is just F and FT is also just F. However, this is not relevant to commuting, we are looking for pairs that do the same thing regardless of the order they are applied.
- For T and D (translation and dilation), similarly, if a translation followed by a dilation produces the same outcome as applying these operations in reverse order, then they commute. But since dilations change the shape and size of objects while translations move them across space without changing their size or orientation relative to their original position, we expect non-commutivity here.
- For R and F (rotation and reflection), if a rotation followed by a reflection produces the same outcome as applying these operations in reverse order, then they commute. Given that reflections change the sign of the y-coordinate and rotations rotate the figure around the origin but do not affect the sign of coordinates, it seems unlikely for them to commute.
- For R and D (rotation and dilation), as with T and D, if a rotation followed by a dilation produces the same outcome as applying these operations in reverse order, then they commute. But since dilations change the size of objects while rotations only change their orientation relative to their original position, we expect non-commutivity here.
- For F and D (reflection and dilation), if a reflection followed by a dilation produces the same outcome as applying these operations in reverse order, then they commute.

## Step 5: Identify pairs of transformations that commute based on composition
After considering each type of transformation pair, we find:
- Translation and rotation do not commute.
- Translation and reflection do commute because TF = FT.
- Translation and dilation do not commute.
- Rotation and reflection might seem as though they could commute but actually do not. For example, rotating a figure by 90 degrees counterclockwise followed by reflecting it across the x-axis would change its position relative to where it originally ended up after rotation alone had been applied.
- Rotation and dilation do not commute.
- Reflection and dilation commute because FD = DF.

## Step 6: Count the number of commuting pairs
Based on our analysis, there are two pairs of transformations that commute:
- Translation and reflection (1 pair)
- Reflection and dilation (1 pair)

Q15: ## Step 1
To solve this problem we need to figure out what values of b make 2024b divisible by 16.
To determine when $2024_{b}$ is divisible by $2^{n}$ (where n is a positive integer) in base b, we can write the expression for $2024_{b}$: \begin{align*} 
2024_b & = 2b^3 +0b^2+ 0b +4\\
&= 2b^3 + 4.
\end{align*}
Now, in order to determine when this is divisible by $2^{n}$ (where n is a positive integer), we can use the following theorem:
Theorem: 
For any prime p and any positive integers a and b, we have that $(a^{b})_{p}$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $b \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.  
Therefore, 2024_b is divisible by $2^ n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, if and only if $b\not\equiv 0 \pmod{2}$.
Thus, it follows that the possible values for b are exactly all the odd integers. Therefore K= (1+\frac{1019}{2}) + (1+\frac{1017}{2}) + ... + (1+\frac{3}{2}). Now we have to add these numbers together: \begin{align*}
K&=(1+513) + (1+509) + (1+507)+\ldots+(1+3)\\
&=514+510+\ldots+4.
\end{align*}

## Step 2
To determine the sum of this arithmetic series, we can use the following formula: 
If a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n are the terms in an arithmetic sequence and d is the common difference between the terms, then their sum S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n), where n denotes the number of terms. Now we can use this formula with d=2 to find K: $$\begin{aligned}
K&=\frac{1019/2}{1}\cdot(514+4)\\
K&=\frac{1019}{2}(518).
\end{aligned}$$

## Step 3
Thus, it follows that $K=\frac{523042}{2}$.
We want to find the sum of the digits in this number, so we need to add up its digits:
\begin{align*}
&\text{ The sum of the digits in}\quad \frac{523042}{2}\\
& = 261521\\
\end{align*}

## Step 4
We can see that the sum of the digits is $5 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 = 15.$

Q17: ## Step 1
To maximize the size of set $S,$ we need to use up as many of the elements in $\{1,\ldots,2024\}$ as possible.

## Step 2
There are some number of even numbers from $1$ to $2024.$ We'll call this count $N_e.$

## Step 3
For each pair of distinct even integers $x,y,$ we have that the absolute value of their difference is at least $4$ or greater, but not more than $6$.

## Step 4
So in any case, for all such pairs $(x,y)$, | x-y | > 2

## Step 5
In particular, given our requirements we can place one even number from $\{1,\ldots,2024\}$ at each of the $1013$ odd integers and obtain a set with $1013+ N_e$ elements.

## Step 6
There are some number of odd numbers from $1$ to $2024,$ which we'll call $N_o.$

## Step 7
Since $x,y \in S$ implies that $\left| x-y\right| >2$ and also $\left|x-y\right|>6$ for odd numbers, we must use one of each pair of adjacent even integers from $1$ to $2024,$ giving us a total of 1013 + N_e elements in the set.

## Step 8
Since there are 1013 odd numbers between 1 and 2024, we can have at most $\boxed{1013}$ elements in $S.$

Q18: ## Step 1: Given the system of equations, let's first try to manipulate them in a way that allows us to solve for a single variable.
To approach this problem, we need to consider how we can use the given system of equations to find the values of $ab$, $bc$, and $ca$. Since we are asked to find $ab + bc + ca$, it seems beneficial to work with sums or products involving these variables.

## Step 2: Consider adding the three given equations together, since this may allow us to simplify and solve for one variable in terms of another.
Adding all three equations, we get $(ab+c) + (bc+a) + (ca+b) = 10 + 87 + 60$. This simplifies to $ab+bc+ca+a+b+c=157$.

## Step 3: Recognize that the sum obtained in step 2 includes terms that are not necessarily integers, since a, b, and c satisfy ab+c = 10, bc+a = 87, and ca+b = 60.
However, notice that we have overcomplicated things. We can take advantage of symmetry and use $ab + bc + ca$ as a common term in each equation.

## Step 4: Instead, let's solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$ by subtracting the first equation from the second and third equations.
Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $(bc+a) - (ab+c) = 87-10$, which simplifies to $bc-ab + a-c = 77$. Subtracting the first equation from the third gives us $(ca+b) - (ab+c) = 60-10$, which simplifies to $ca-bc + c-a = 50$.

## Step 5: Solve for $a, b,$ and $c$ by using these derived equations in conjunction with the original system of equations.
However, we made a mistake. We need to take advantage of the fact that $(ab+bc+ca)$ is present in each equation. So let's add all three equations together.

## Step 6: Summing all three equations gives us $2(ab + bc + ca) + (a+b+c) = 157$, which can be rearranged as $2(ab + bc + ca) = 157 - (ab + bc + ca)$.
This equation is helpful, but we still need to get rid of the $(ab+bc+ca)$ term.

## Step 7: However, upon closer inspection, notice that when we added all three equations together in step 2, we obtained $ab+bc+ca+a+b+c=157$. We can rewrite this as $a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 157$.
This equation appears to involve the same terms over and over again.

## Step 8: Since we have equations like $ab+c=10$, $bc+a=87$, and $ca+b=60$, consider expressing each term in the form of these given equations.
Notice that we can rewrite our sum as $(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b)$.

## Step 9: Since we know from our original system of equations that $(ab+c)=10, (bc+a)=87$, and $(ca+b)=60$, let's substitute these values into the equation $a(b+c)+b(c+a)+c(a+b)$.
By doing this substitution, we get $10 + 87 + 60$.

## Step 10: The expression simplifies to $157$. But remember that we want $ab+bc+ca$, not just the sum of these three values.
In other words, $(ab+c)+(bc+a)+(ca+b)$ is equal to $157$, which implies $(ab+bc+ca)+a+b+c=157$.

## Step 11: To eliminate the unwanted terms in our equation, we need another way to express $a + b + c$. Let's go back to the original equations for some inspiration.
Notice that if we subtract each of the given equations from the sum $(ab+c)+(bc+a)+(ca+b)$, then we can isolate $ab+bc+ca$.

## Step 12: Subtracting the first equation from our expression in step 11 gives us $(ab + bc + ca) + a - c = 157 - (ab + c)$.
Notice that this simplifies to $(ab+bc+ca)+a-c=147$, because we know $ab+c$ equals 10.

## Step 13: Similarly, subtracting the second equation from our expression gives us $(ab + bc + ca) + b - a = 157 - (bc+a)$.
Again, this simplifies to $(ab+bc+ca)+b-a=70$, because we know $bc+a$ equals 87.

## Step 14: Subtracting the third equation from our expression gives us $(ab + bc + ca) + c - b = 157 - (ca+b)$.
Once more, this simplifies to $(ab+bc+ca)+c-b=70$, because we know $ca+b$ equals 60.

## Step 15: Now that we have three equations involving our desired variable and a single other term in each equation, let's solve the system by adding them together to eliminate unwanted terms.
This gives us $3(ab + bc + ca) = (ab+bc+ca)+a-c+(ab+bc+ca)+b-a+(ab+bc+ca)+c-b$.

## Step 16: Simplifying our equation from step 15, we have that $3(ab+bc+ca)=147+70+70$. This gives us a total of $(ab+bc+ca)$ is equal to $\frac{287}{3}$.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{287}{3}}$ vs 276 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q19: ## Step 1: Identify the movements corresponding to each roll
The movement for x-direction (A+/A-) is either +1 or -1. Similarly, the movement for y-direction (B+/B-) is either +1 or -1, and for z-direction (C+/C-) is also either +1 or -1.

## Step 2: Determine the total number of possible outcomes
Since there are 4 rolls (2 for x, 2 for y, and 2 for z), each with 2 possible results (+ or -), we can find the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of possibilities for each roll together. This gives us $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$ possible outcomes.

## Step 3: Calculate the favorable outcomes
To traverse a unit cube with distinct edges, the bee must make at least one move in each dimension (x, y, z). We will consider two cases to calculate the favorable outcomes:
- Case 1: The first roll is positive.
In this case, we have $4! = 24$ possible ways for the remaining three rolls to be distinct and of opposite sign. However, since only one out of four positions can be occupied by a positive or negative roll in each direction, there are $2\cdot3=6$ distinct sets of 3 moves. So the total number of outcomes in this case is 4.
- Case 2: The first roll is negative.
This case has the same favorable outcomes as Case 1.

## Step 4: Calculate the probability
The probability can be calculated by adding up the favorable outcomes from both cases, then dividing that sum by the total possible outcomes. Since there are 8 distinct ways to pick a set of three moves and each move has two possibilities (positive or negative), we find that the number of favorable outcomes is $2 \cdot 4 = 8$. Thus, the probability of reaching the desired result is $\frac{8}{16}$.

## Step 5: Simplify the fraction
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. In this case, we have $\frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}$.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ vs 7/54 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q20: ## Step 1: Let's define what we're given
The problem states that the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship of positions in a line
In a line, if someone is nth from one end and mth from the other, then (n + m -1) people are between them and they are one of those people. We can use this information to solve for the number of people.

## Step 3: Plug in the given values into the relationship formula
1013 (people from left) + 1010 (people from right) - 1 = total_people_in_line

## Step 4: Solve for the number of people in line
1013 + 1010 - 1 = 2022.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2022}$ vs 2022 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%
