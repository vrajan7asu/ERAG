Q2: 1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b using the given information. We have two equations based on the model T = aL + bG:

69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
69 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. Solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b. You can use substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 10/9 to make the coefficients of G in both equations equal:
(69 * 10/9) = (a * 10/9)(1.5) + b(800)
76.67 ≈ a + b(800)

Now, subtract the second equation from this new equation:
76.67 - 69 = (b(800)) - (b(1100))
7.67 = -300b
b ≈ -0.0256

Substitute b back into either equation to find a:
69 = a(1.5) + (-0.0256)(800)
69 = a(1.5) - 20.48
a ≈ 51.92/1.5
a ≈ 34.61

So, the model is T = 34.61L - 0.0256G.

3. Now, we can estimate the time it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet:

T = a(4.2) + b(4000)
T = (34.61)(4.2) - (0.0256)(4000)
T ≈ 143.42 - 102.4
T ≈ 41.02 minutes

Q3: 1. Identify five distinct prime numbers.

2. Find their sum.

3. Check if the resulting number is also a prime.

4. If it's not a prime, repeat the process with different primes until you find a sum that is a prime.

5. The sum of this prime can be found by adding its digits together.

Let's try with the first five prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Their sum is 28, which is not a prime number. Let's continue to look for other combinations of distinct primes.

After trying different combinations, we find that the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes is 31 (5+7+9+1+9). The digits of this number are 3 and 1. Their sum is $3 + 1 = \boxed{4}$. vs 7 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q4: 1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 2024 as the sum of two-digit numbers and find the minimum number of these two-digit numbers required.

2. **Initial Consideration:**
   The maximum sum we can get from a single two-digit number is \(99\). Therefore, if we use multiple two-digit numbers, the sum must be less than or equal to:
   \[
   10 \times 99 = 990
   \]
   Since 2024 exceeds this limit, we need at least one more two-digit number. Hence, we need at least \(11\) two-digit numbers because:
   \[
   11 \times 99 = 1089 < 2024 < 12 \times 99 = 1188
   \]

3. **Estimate the Sum of Two-Digit Numbers:**
   The average two-digit number is around \(50\). Therefore, to get close to 2024 using two-digit numbers:
   \[
   \frac{2024}{50} = 40.48
   \]
   Since we need whole numbers of two-digit sums, we use \(41\) numbers to estimate the sum:
   \[
   41 \times 50 = 2050
   \]
   This is slightly more than 2024.

4. **Refine the Estimate:**
   We need a closer estimation using \(41\) two-digit numbers:
   - If each number is around \(49\), we have:
     \[
     41 \times 49 = 2009
     \]
     This is less than 2024. We need more sum to reach 2024. Therefore, we try to increase the numbers' values slightly above \(49\). 

5. **Calculate Minimum Sum:**
   Suppose we have \(x\) two-digit numbers such that:
   \[
   10 \leq x_i < 99
   \]
   We need to satisfy:
   \[
   x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 2024
   \]
   Given each number \(x_i\) is less than 99, we get:
   \[
   2024 < n \times 99 \Rightarrow n > \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.45 \Rightarrow n \geq 21
   \]

6. **Verification with \(n = 21\):**
   Let's check if using exactly \(21\) two-digit numbers suffices:
   - If all numbers are around \(50\), the sum is too large, so we need a combination of smaller and larger numbers.
   - A practical distribution could be:
     \[
     6 \times 48 + 15 \times 52 = 2024
     \]
   Therefore, using \(21\) two-digit numbers, the sum can indeed be reached exactly.

### Conclusion:
The minimum number of two-digit numbers required to write the sum as 2024 is:
\[
\boxed{21}

Q5: 2024 = 2^3 * 506

The prime factorization of 2024 shows it has three factors of 2 and one factor of 506. To find the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024, we need to ensure that n! contains at least these factors.

n! must contain:
- Three factors of 2 (which are already present in any factorial greater than 1)
- One factor of 506

Since 506 is not a prime number, it has its own factors as well. Let's find them:
506 = 2 * 253

So, n! must contain at least:
- Three factors of 2 (already present in any factorial greater than 1)
- One factor of 2 (from the factorization of 506)
- One factor of 253

Now, let's look for the smallest n such that n! contains these factors. We can see that 8! is the first factorial containing three factors of 2 and one factor of 253 (since 253 < 9). Therefore, the least value of n is:

Q6: 1. **Identify the Goal**:
   The task is to transform the string \( \text{ABCDEF} \) into \( \text{FEDCBA} \) by swapping adjacent letters. We need to determine the minimum number of such swaps required.

2. **Understanding Swaps**:
   Each swap changes two adjacent characters, so it does not alter the relative order of any other pairs except these two. Therefore, tracking the positions of all characters and ensuring they end up in their final places is crucial.

3. **Final Positions**:
   - \( A \) needs to move from position 1 to position 6.
   - \( B \) needs to move from position 2 to position 5.
   - \( C \) needs to move from position 3 to position 4.
   - \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) need to move one place each, but since they are already in descending order, they just need to maintain their relative positions.

4. **Counting the Moves**:
   - To move \( A \) from position 1 to 6 requires 5 moves: (A swaps with B, AB swaps with C, ABC swaps with D, ABCD swaps with E, and ABCDE swaps with F).
   - Similarly, \( B \) requires 4 moves: (B swaps with C, BC swaps with D, BCD swaps with E, BCD swaps with F).
   - \( C \) requires 3 moves: (C swaps with D, CD swaps with E, CDE swaps with F).

5. **Total Moves Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Moves} = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string \( \text{ABCDEF} \) that are needed to change it to \( \text{FEDCBA} \) is:
   \[
   \boxed{12}

Q7: 1. To find the least possible positive sum of three integers whose product is 60, we need to minimize the absolute values of these integers while keeping their product equal to

60. This way, the sum will be as small as possible.

2. The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2 \times 3 \times 5$. To get three factors from this prime factorization, we can distribute these prime factors among three integers in different ways. However, to minimize their absolute values and thus the sum, it's better to have one integer with a larger absolute value and two smaller integers.

3. By distributing the prime factors as follows: $2 \times 2 \times (3 \times 5) = -2 \times (-2) \times 15$, we get three integers whose product is 60 and have the smallest possible positive sum. Note that we choose $-2$ for one integer to ensure a positive sum since otherwise, all integers would be positive or zero, increasing their absolute values and the sum.

4. The least possible positive sum of these three integers is: $-2 + (-2) + 15 = \boxed{11}$. vs 3 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q8: 1. **Calculate Individual Packing Rates**:
   - Amy packs $4$ packages every $3$ minutes, so her rate is $\frac{4}{3}$ packages per minute.
   - Bomani packs $3$ packages every $3$ minutes, so his rate is $1$ package per minute.
   - Charlie also packs $3$ packages every $3$ minutes, so his rate is also $1$ package per minute.
   - Daria packs $5$ packages every $4$ minutes, so her rate is $\frac{5}{4}$ packages per minute.

2. **Total Packing Rate Before Daria Joined**:
   \[
   \text{Total rate} = \frac{4}{3} + 1 + 1 = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ packages per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate Packages Packed Before Daria Joined**:
   - They worked from $1:00$ PM to some time before $2:45$ PM.
   - Assume they packed for $t$ minutes before Daria joined. Then, the number of packages they packed is $\frac{10}{3} \times t$.

4. **Calculate Packages Packed After Daria Joined**:
   - From the time Daria joined until $2:45$ PM, they worked for $(60 - t)$ minutes (since $2:45$ PM is $60$ minutes after $1:00$ PM).
   - The total number of packages packed in this interval is $\left(\frac{10}{3} + \frac{5}{4}\right) \times (60 - t)$.

5. **Set Up Equation for Total Packages**:
   \[
   \frac{10}{3} \times t + \left(\frac{10}{3} + \frac{5}{4}\right) \times (60 - t) = 450
   \]

6. **Simplify and Solve for $t$**:
   \[
   \frac{10}{3}t + \left(\frac{40}{12} + \frac{15}{12}\right)(60 - t) = 450
   \]
   \[
   \frac{10}{3}t + \frac{55}{12}(60 - t) = 450
   \]
   \[
   \frac{10}{3}t + \frac{55}{12} \times 60 - \frac{55}{12}t = 450
   \]
   \[
   \frac{10}{3}t + 27.5 - \frac{55}{12}t = 450
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{10}{3} - \frac{55}{12}\right)t = 450 - 27.5

Q9: 1. First, we need to determine the total number of ways to select 2 juniors from 6 for one team. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula $nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to select 2 juniors from 6 is ${6\choose2} = 15$.

2. Next, we need to determine the number of ways to divide 6 seniors into two groups so that each group has 3 members. The first step is to choose 3 seniors out of 6 for one group, which can be done in ${6\choose3} = 20$ ways.

3. However, this count includes both (A,B,C) and (C,B,A), which are considered different but actually represent the same division into two groups. So, we need to divide our count by 3! (which is the number of ways to arrange 3 items). This gives us $\frac{20}{6} = {6\choose3}/3 = {6\choose3}/{3!\choose3}$.

4. Now, we have calculated the number of ways to select 2 juniors for one team and divide the seniors into two groups with 3 members each. But we also need to consider the different ways to form the second and third teams. Since there are still 4 juniors and 3 seniors left after forming the first team, we can again choose 2 juniors from 4 for the second team in ${4\choose2} = 6$ ways.

5. For the seniors, there is only one way to divide them into two groups since there are only 2 seniors left. So, the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams with the given conditions is $15 * {6\choose3}/{3!\choose3} * 6 = 3600$.

So, the final answer is $\boxed{3600}$. vs 1350 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q10: 1. **Understanding the Operation**:
   - If \( n \) is a multiple of 3, replace \( n \) with \( \frac{n}{3} \).
   - If \( n \) is not a multiple of 3, replace \( n \) with \( n+10 \).

2. **Analyzing the Process**:
   - We start with \( n = 100 \).
   - Since 100 is divisible by 3 (as \( 100 \div 3 = 33.33\ldots \)), we replace 100 with \( \frac{100}{3} = 33.33\ldots \), but since we need an integer, we consider the floor value which is 33.
   - Now, \( n = 33 \). Since 33 is not divisible by 3, we add 10 to get \( 33 + 10 = 43 \).
   - Continue this process for 100 iterations.

3. **General Pattern**:
   - We need to determine the pattern of operations and how many times each operation is applied.
   - Since we are performing the operations exactly 100 times, we need to find a general formula or pattern that emerges after multiple iterations.

4. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - Let's consider the operations in terms of their effect on \( n \):
     - If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( n \to \frac{n}{3} \).
     - If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( n \to n+10 \).
   - We need to track how many times each operation is applied and its cumulative effect on \( n \).

5. **Tracking the Operations**:
   - After each iteration, we check if the new value of \( n \) is divisible by 3. If yes, divide by 3; otherwise, add 10.
   - This process needs to be repeated exactly 100 times.

6. **Calculating the Final Value**:
   - After each operation, we need to check if the resulting number is divisible by 3 and adjust accordingly.
   - Since we are performing the operations exactly 100 times, we need to ensure that we are not missing any iterations where \( n \) might be divisible by 3.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - We start with \( n = 100 \).
   - After 100 iterations, we need to determine the final value of \( n \).
   - Given the operations, we can track the changes and find the final value by simulating the process.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - After performing the operations exactly 100 times, we find that the final value of \( n \) is \( \boxed{43} \). vs 30 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q12: 1. First, let's understand what "commute" means in this context. Two transformations commute if the order of applying them does not affect the final result.

2. Now, let's analyze each transformation and how it affects the coordinate plane:
   - Translation 2 units right: This shifts every point in the plane 2 units to the right.
   - 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This moves every point in the plane in a circular path around the origin, counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
   - Reflection across x-axis: This reflects every point in the plane across the x-axis.
   - Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This stretches or shrinks every point in the plane from the origin by a factor of 2.

3. Let's now check if any pair of these transformations commute:
   - Translation and rotation do not commute, as translating then rotating gives a different result than rotating then translating.
   - Rotation and reflection across x-axis commute because both transformations are reflections with respect to lines through the origin (the y-axis for reflection and the diagonal line for rotation), so applying either transformation twice results in the original configuration.
   - Reflection across x-axis and dilation do not commute, as dilating then reflecting gives a different result than reflecting then dilating.
   - Dilation and translation commute because both transformations are rigid motions that preserve distances, so applying either transformation followed by the other results in the same configuration (just translated or dilated differently).
   - Rotation and dilation do not commute, as rotating then dilating gives a different result than dilating then rotating.

4. Therefore, only two pairs of transformations commute: translation and rotation, and dilation and reflection across x-axis.

Q13: 1. Define \( M \) as the largest integer such that both \( M + 1213 \) and \( M + 3773 \) are perfect squares. Let these perfect squares be represented by \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \), respectively. Hence, we can write:
   \[
   M + 1213 = x^2
   \]
   \[
   M + 3773 = y^2
   \]

2. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( M \):
   \[
   (M + 3773) - (M + 1213) = y^2 - x^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2560 = y^2 - x^2
   \]

3. Recognize that the difference of two squares can be factored as follows:
   \[
   y^2 - x^2 = (y + x)(y - x)
   \]
   Set this equal to 2560:
   \[
   2560 = (y + x)(y - x)
   \]

4. Since \( y > x \), we need to factorize 2560 into two factors such that one is a perfect square and the other is four times a perfect square. The prime factorization of 2560 is:
   \[
   2560 = 2^9 \cdot 5 = (2^4)^2 \cdot (2 \cdot 5)
   \]
   This means that \( y - x \) must be twice a perfect square, and \( y + x \) must also fit into the product.

5. Assign values to \( y - x \) as follows:
   \[
   y - x = 2 \cdot 32 = 64
   \]
   Solving for \( y + x \):
   \[
   (y + x)(y - x) = 2560 \implies y + x = \frac{2560}{64} = 40
   \]

6. Solve the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
      y - x = 64 \\
      y + x = 40
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Adding these equations gives us:
   \[
   2y = 104 \implies y = 52
   \]
   Subtracting these equations gives us:
   \[
   2x = -24 \implies x = -12
   \]

7. With \( y = 52 \) and \( x = -12 \), substitute back into one of the original equations to find \( M \):
   \[
   M + 1213 = (-12)^2 = 144
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   M = 144 - 1213 = -1069
   \]

8. Finally, determine the units digit of \( M \):
   \[
   -1069
   \]
   The units digit of \( -1069 \) is:

Q15: 1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We are given that \(2024_b\) must be divisible by 16 for some base \(b\). We need to find how many such bases \(b\) exist in the range \(5 \leq b \leq 2024\) and then sum their digits.

2. **Divisibility Rule for 16**:
   For a number \(n\) to be divisible by 16, its last four digits must form a number that is divisible by 16. Here, the number in base \(b\) is \(2024_b\).

3. **Analyzing \(2024_b\)**:
   In base \(b\), \(2024_b = 2 \cdot b^3 + 0 \cdot b^2 + 2 \cdot b^1 + 4\). We need this to be divisible by 16.

4. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   Since we are dealing with a base \(b\) number, we focus on the last two digits (in decimal terms) of \(2024_b\), which is \(2b + 4\). For this to be divisible by 16, \(2b + 4\) must end in a digit that makes it divisible by 16.

5. **Finding \(b\)**:
   We need \(2b + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{16}\). Simplifying this, we get \(2b \equiv -4 \pmod{16}\), or \(2b \equiv 12 \pmod{16}\). Dividing through by 2, we have \(b \equiv 6 \pmod{8}\).

6. **Counting Valid Bases**:
   The valid bases are \(b = 6, 14, 22, \ldots\) up to the maximum allowed base. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 8.

7. **Summing the Digits of \(K\)**:
   The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving \(6 + (n-1) \cdot 8 = 2024\). Solving for \(n\), we get \(n = 253\).
   The sum of the digits of 253 is \(2 + 5 + 3 = 10\).

Q16: 1. **Identify the common ratio (r):**
   Since \(720\) is the second term and \(a\) is the first, the common ratio \(r\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{a}
   \]
   where \(a < 720\).

2. **Determine the possible values of \(r\):**
   Since \(a\) is an integer less than \(720\), and \(720\) is a multiple of \(8\) (as \(720 = 8 \times 90\)), \(r\) must be a rational number whose square root is also a rational number. The possible values of \(r\) that are fractions with denominators dividing \(90\) and less than \(720\) are:
   \[
   r = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{7}{8}, \frac{9}{10}
   \]

3. **Calculate the corresponding values of \(b\):**
   - For \(r = \frac{1}{2}\), \(b = 720 \times 2 = 1440\)
   - For \(r = \frac{3}{4}\), \(b = 720 \times \frac{4}{3} = 960\)
   - For \(r = \frac{5}{6}\), \(b = 720 \times \frac{6}{5} = 864\)
   - For \(r = \frac{7}{8}\), \(b = 720 \times \frac{8}{7} = 768\)
   - For \(r = \frac{9}{10}\), \(b = 720 \times \frac{10}{9} = 800\)

4. **Find the least possible value of \(b\):**
   The least possible value of \(b\) among these is \(800\).

5. **Sum of the digits of \(b\):**
   \[
   8 + 0 + 0 = 8
   \]

Thus, the sum of the digits of the least possible value of \(b\) is \(\boxed{8}\). vs 21 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

   - This means each move must result in a new edge, and no two moves can be redundant in terms of their effect on the cube's edges.

5. **Counting Valid Paths:**
   - Consider the first move: it has 8 possible outcomes.
   - For each subsequent move, we need to ensure that it does not cancel out or repeat any of the previous moves.
   - After the first move, there are \(6\) valid directions for the second move (since one direction is redundant).
   - For the third move, there are \(4\) valid directions (excluding the two directions that would cancel the first and second moves).
   - For the fourth move, there are \(2\) valid directions (excluding the two directions that would cancel the effect of the previous two moves).
   - Therefore, the number of valid paths is:
     \[
     8 \times 6 \times 4 \times 2 = 384
     \]

6. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that the bee traverses exactly 4 distinct edges is the ratio of valid paths to total possible paths:
     \[
     \frac{384}{4096} = \frac{1}{10.75}
     \]
   - However, this fraction simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{384}{4096} = \frac{3}{32}
     \]

The final answer is $\boxed{\frac{3}{32}}$. vs 7/54 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q20: 1. Identify the position of the person from both ends:
   - From the left: The person is the $1013^\text{th}$.
   - From the right: The person is the $1010^\text{th}$.

2. Set up the equation to find the total number of people in the line:
   \[
   1013 + 1010 = \text{Total number of people}
   \]

3. Calculate the total:
   \[
   1013 + 1010 = 2023
   \]

Thus, the total number of people in the line is $\boxed{2023}$. vs 2022 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%
