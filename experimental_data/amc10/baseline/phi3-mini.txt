Q2: To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of constants `a` and `b`. We can set up two equations based on the information given. Let's denote T1 = 69 minutes for a trail with L1 = 1.5 miles and G1 = 80enerical gain in feet (feet is not typically used, but I will assume it represents an altitude unit similar to meters). And let's call these values as well:

Equation 1 (`aL + bG`): `69 = a(1.5) + b(800)`  
Equation 2 (with the other set of given data, we could have different altitude gain here but for consistency let's assume it as another example with G2 and T2 values being unknown variables: Let’s say `T2 = a(1.2) + b(G2)` where both are also in their appropriate units).

With only one equation, we can not solve this system because there are two unknowns (`a` and `b`). We need at least another complete data point to create the second independent equation needed for solving these variables (as it stands as a problem with insufficient information cannot be solved directly without making assumptions). If more hiking times/data points were provided, we could solve this system of equations. 

However since no additional details are given in your instruction I will make an assumption to create the second equation and proceed: Let's assume T2 = a(1.2) + b(900). Now using these two sets of values (equations), we can solve for `a` and `b`.

The system becomes:  
Equation 1 (`69 = a*1.5 + b*800`)  
Assumed Equation 2 (`T2 = a*1.2 + b*900`)   
Where T2 is the unknown time we need to find out given that `L3`=4.2 miles and `G3`=4000 feet (let's assume G3 refers directly to altitude gain in 'feet'). 

Using these two equations, let’s solve for a and b first:  
Let T1 = 69 minutes be the time it takes on Equation 1. Since we don't have another actual value from hiking experience besides this one scenario to formulate our second equation based on different trail lengths or altitude gains, let’s just use an arbitrary example for illustration:
Assume T2 = a(1.8) + b(600). This is purely hypothetical and assumes that when the length of trails doubles (from 1.5 miles to 3 miles), it takes less time than we initially thought, but since altitude has not changed significantly compared with Equation 1 scenario's G2 = 800 feet -> our assumed G2 = 600 in T2 equation, the increased hiking speed (assuming linear correlation).

Now you have two equations:  
Equation 1 (`69 = a*1.5 + b*800`)  
Assumed Equation 2 (`T2 = a*1.8 + b*600`, where T2 is unknown)   
And we want to find `a` and `b`. Let’s use the method of substitution or elimination:
(I'll do an example calculation, but I should note that without precise data for another hike time/altitude scenario (T2), this solution will remain hypothetical.)  
Multiply Assumed Equation 1 by -0.6 and Add it to Assumed Equation 2:  
-41.4 + T2 = a*3 + b*590    ...(I'll call this new equation New Equation)    
Subtract the actual time for our assumed scenario from the calculated one (we don’t have real values so we can only express it symbolically):  
T - 41.4 = a*(3-1.5) + b*(600-800)    ...(This represents hypothetical equation derived based on another unspecified hiking scenario which I am arbitrarily defining as 'Assumed T2')    
Now we have two new equations in terms of `a` and `b`:  
1. -41.4 + 69 = a*1.5 + b*800 => Equation A (from actual data)    ...(This simplifies to: 27.6 = a*1.5 + b*800; this is our original equation simplified for demonstration purposes.)  
2. T - 41.4 = a*1.5 + b*(-200); let's call it New Equation B (from hypothetical scenario).    ...(This represents the difference in time between an unspecified hike and our arbitrary example, which I am defining as 'Assumed T')

Now we have two equations with variables `a` and `b`, but to find actual values for them you would normally solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination. However without exact numbers provided from another hiking scenario (T2), it's not possible here, making the solution hypothetical based on an example we used with arbitrary data:
Assumed T = 65 minutes; let’s assume for our purposes and continue to demonstrate how one would normally solve such a system.  
Now using elimination method or substitution (if this were real numbers), you could find `a` and `b`. After finding the actual values of these constants, we can then input L3 = 4.2 miles and G3 = 4000 feet into our model to calculate T:
T_estimate = a*L + b*G  
And this would give us an estimate for time `T` in minutes given the length of trail (`L`) is now known, but without specific numbers we cannot provide you with an exact answer. The purpose here was purely illustrative to demonstrate how one might approach finding such constants and making predictions using linear models when appropriate data are available. vs 246 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q10: To solve this problem efficiently, we can notice that every three steps (divide by 3), the result is an integer. Since 100 divided by 3 gives us approximately 33 with a remainder of 1, after dividing 100 by 3 about 33 times and getting to numbers close but not exactly divisible by 3 repeatedly, we will eventually reach an integral value that can be further reduced through division. We continue this process until the resulting number is either less than or equal to three (in which case it's inherently a multiple of 3) or after four operations reaches below two and becomes one again because adding ten then would make eleven, not divisible by three but above two—thus necessitating an additional addition.

Here’s the step-by-step process: (I will only show every division that significantly changes n to give us insight into this cyclical behavior.)

100 → 16 → 8 → 3 → ..., until we reach a number less than or equal to three. Then it reduces further by dividing with 3 as many times possible before repeating the non-multiple of 3 + 10 operation one last time if needed (when n is an odd integer).

The final result after performing this procedure will be reached in fewer operations since we're adding ten whenever division doesn’t yield a multiple of three. Since it takes more than 97/3 divisions to reach into the single digits, let's find out when that happens and see if any additional additions apply:

100 → 16 (divide by 3) -> ... 2_...
To simplify further without performing all operations manually requires understanding a pattern. We can iterate in code or calculate with pen and paper while recognizing this cyclical nature of the problem, but I will skip to providing an analytical approach:

Since we know division only happens every three steps when n is divisible by 3 (which occurs approximately one-third as many times), most operations are addition due to non-divisibility. Given that there's a minimum number of additions before any reduction, and considering the nature of our sequence with alternating divisions and increments not reaching multiples of three until later steps, we expect to arrive near 2 or above (needing an increment) but below roughly nine in two-digit range where division becomes possible again.

After some analysis without explicit calculation: If you start at a number just over a multiple that can be divided by 3 and perform this sequence exactly ten times starting from n=100, considering the reduction pattern we have described so far, it's more complex to derive an exact answer analytically but much easier with algorithmic assistance.

Using Python for example:
```python
n = 100
for _ in range(100):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        n //= 3
    else:
        n += 10
print(f"{int((Decimal(n) + (n - int(n))) / Decimal('2'))}")
```
This script would give the exact answer. Let's say it outputs $8$, which seems like a plausible result given our pattern understanding, but this is just an educated guess to illustrate how you could compute and understand such sequences programmatically without doing all manual iterations step by step. For precise results in similar problems with repetitive operations that have simple rules for transitions between states (here the division/addition), it's often practical or necessary to simulate these steps using code, which allows us not only speed but also accuracy and understanding of such cyclical processes without tedious manual calculation. vs 30 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q15: The key insight here is to recognize that for any positive integers b such that $5 \leq b \leq 2024$, we want the base-b representation of 2024 to have at least four digits (since it must be divisible by 16, and a number is only divisible by 1de if its highest power of 2 dividing into it has an exponent greater than or equal to $k$). In other words, we want the base-b representation of $\text{base(2024)}$ (let's call this as X) to have at least four digits.

Now consider that any positive integer written in base b can be expressed by its decimal form:
X = abc...=a*b^3 + b*b^2 + c * ... 
For a given n, the largest term is always when we reach $b^{n-1}$, so to find at least four digits in X for any positive integer m, it must be that (m/b) >= 4. Therefore:
(2024 / b) $\geq$ 4 => b <= 506
Since K represents the count of all integers between [5 and 2024] which fulfills this condition in base-b, we find that $K = \text{floor}(2024 - 5 + 1)$ (because both endpoints are included). Hence:
$K = \text{%(2020)}=678$ integers. To calculate the sum of digits for K itself in base-b, we convert it to decimal and get $K_{dec} = 4*(506^3) + (5*506^2) + (11*506) + 2$. Thus:
$%(K_{digits})= %(%($K_{dec}$))=${9}+{8}+{$+$}={+$+$} = $ ${+$}$, where the final digit is summed as a fraction of dollar signs for clarity. vs 20 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q16: We know that in a geometric sequence, each term after the first two can be found by multiplying the previous terms together. So we have three equations involving $a$, 720 and $b$:
$720 = ab$ (1)
and since it's a G.P., $\frac{b}{720} =\sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{ab}}$ or equivalently, $b^2=a^2$ by taking cube root of both sides and simplifying: 
$\Longrightarrow b = \pm a$ (since we are dealing with integers) $(2)$. Substituting equation (2) into the first two equations gives us four possible sets for values of $a$, $b$ and their relationship. Here they all are listed alongwith solutions to obtain minimum value of $b$:
1: -$360, 720,-2880$, Minimum is $-2880$. Sum = $|-2+8+8|=14$
2:  359, 720, $-\frac{2}{3}$ *(not an integer)* , No solution for a G.P with negative term here; hence not considered further .    
3: -648, 720,-$\frac{4}{3}$, or $-648, 72ner-12$, Minimum is $-651$ and sum = $|-6+5|=1$.   
Thus the answer to our question (min. $b$) has digit sum of $1$. $\blacksquare$ vs 21 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q18: We can rewrite the given equations as follows:

(1) ab + c = 10
(2) ac + b = 87 - c
(3) bc + a = 60 - a

Now we want to find the value of (ab + bc + ca). We can rewrite this expression as follows:

(ab + bc + ca) = ab + bc + ac + c

Let'self-contained question be: Integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy $ab + c = 10$, $ac + b = 87 - c$, and $bc + a = 60 - a$. What is the value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$?
Answer: To find $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$, let's first add all three given equations together to eliminate one variable at a time. Adding them gives us:

$ab + ac + bc + 2c = 10 + (87 - c) + (60 - a)$

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

$(a+b+c) \cdot ab/2 + 3c = 157 - a$

Now let's find $(a+b+c)$. We can do this by squaring both sides of equations (1), (2), and (3) individually, then subtracting them. This eliminates the mixed terms:

$(ab + c)^2 = 10^2 \implies a^2 b^2 + 2abc + c^2 = 100$
$(ac + b)^2 = (87 - c)^2 \implies a^2 c^2 + 2abc + b^2 c^2 = 7569 - 174c + c^2$
$(bc + a)^2 = (60 - a)^2 \implies b^2 c^2 + 2abc + a^2 c^2 = 3600 - 120a + a^2$

Subtracting these equations gives us:

$-(a+b+c)(ab/2) + (7569 - c^2 - 3600 + c^2) = 100 - 100 + 100 \implies -(a+b+c)(ab/2) = 456$
$(ab/2) = -456(a+b+c)$

Substituting this back into the previous equation, we get:

$(a^2 b^2 + c^2)/-10 + (7569 - 3600 + c^2)/(-456) = a + b + c$
$ab/2(b+c - a)^2 / (-10)(-456) = -(a + b + c)$
$(a + b + c) \cdot (a + b + c) / 912 = ab + ac + bc $
$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a*b/2 - a*c/2 - b*c/2 = -(ab + ac + bc)$
$(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (1/4)(ab + ac + bc) = -(ab + ac + bc)$
$5(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = -3(ab + ac + bc)$

Now, let's substitute the given equations into this last equation:

$5(10 - c) = -3(87 - 2c)$
$50 - 5c = -261 + 6c$
$11c = -311$
$c = -29$

Now that we have the value of $c$, we can substitute it back into equations (1) and (2) to find values for $a$ and $b$:

(1) $-29 + ab = 10 \implies a \cdot b = 39$
(2) $-29 \cdot a + b = 87 - (-29) \implies a \cdot (b + 29) = 87 + 29 \implies ab + 29a = 116$

We can now solve these equations simultaneously:

From the first equation, $ab = 39$, and from the second one, we have $(39 - a^2)/a + 29a = 116/a \implies (39 - a^2) + 29a^2 = 116 \implies 28a^2 = 77 \implies a^2 = 7/4$

Similarly, we can find $b^2$:

$(ab)/a + b^2/(b+29) - ab = 39 - (ab)^2 /(ab + 29a)$
$-((-29)(-10)) - ((7/4)-(-29))^2 / (58/4)=$
$\implies -29 \cdot 6\sqrt{3} = -162/4 $
$\implies b^2= (-162/4) + a^2 = (-162+7)/4 = -155/4 $

Now, we can find the value of $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)$:

$(a^2 +b^2+c^2)= 7/4 -155/4 + (-29)^2= 30$ vs 276 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q19: The problem statement seems to contain some confusion regarding how movements in three dimensions (3D) relate to "traversing edges" and the specific rules for movement given by die rolls. For clarity, I'll interpret it as a bee moving inside a unit cube where each face of the cube represents an edge extending outward from one corner, which is not typical terminology but necessary here since we are dealing with discrete movements based on dice and edges in 3D space might imply movement along planes within that volume.

However, if what' end up aiming to calculate seems like a bee moving across distinct faces (edges) without revisiting the same face twice while ensuring it ends at different corners of those four chosen surfaces – which is highly unusual and practically impossible due to constraints on movement directionality based on die rolls provided. The term "4 distinct edges" would typically refer in a cube context, rather than faces or planes unless these are considered as paths between vertices (corners), making this problem more complex but still solvable with combinatorics and probability theory principles under certain interpretations of the rules.

Let's consider two likely scenarios for clarity: 
1) If by "distinct edges" we mean that each roll must result in a unique vertex being reached (thus implying reaching four different corners). However, this is impossible because rolling to reach one corner from another within these constraints would necessarily require revisiting some vertices due to the deterministic nature of die movements.
2) If "distinct edges" refers only to directional changes without regard for their planar position (either face or plane), then we can proceed with a calculation, but this interpretation also leads into complexity beyond simple direct probabilities since movement options depend on previous rolls and the resulting vertices reached after each move.

Assuming scenario 2 holds true where "distinct edges" refers to directional changes without concern for their planar position within faces or planes – we need more specific rules about how movements can result in reaching a different vertex while ensuring not revisiting any face (edge). This interpretation would require conditional probabilities that depend on prior rolls, which makes direct calculation non-trivial.

Since the problem as stated is complex and ambiguous regarding "traversing edges" within 3D space constraints based on die results without returning to previously touched vertices or faces—and assuming there's no simplifying condition like 'the bee cannot move backward in one dimension unless moving forward', which would make direct computation feasible.

For a more solvable version, we could reframe the question as: "What is the probability that after four rolls of a die (and considering each number corresponds to movement along x, y, or z), at least once within these movements does the bee end up on one corner different from all others?" The answer for this specific problem would require conditional probabilities based on previous outcomes and combinatorial analysis but falls outside simple direct calculation due to multiple constraints.

Given the ambiguity of "distinct edges" in a 3D context with deterministic die roll movements, we cannot provide an exact probability without additional rules or clarifications about movement behavior within this cube space as it stands today – thus rendering such calculations currently unfeasible under these conditions directly from provided information.

If further details are to be considered for the scenario where "distinct edges" means reaching distinct vertices in a unit-cube context (under deterministic die movements), then we need rules that govern how each roll translates into movement on this cube, taking care not to revisit faces or planes already traversed. A probabilistic model could be developed under those conditions with more specific constraints and behavioral models for dice movements within the three-dimensional space of a unit cube – but such an exercise is beyond direct computation from given information without further rule specification on non-revisitation policies during movement sequences among vertices (corners). vs 7/54 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%
