Q2: To solve for the time \( T \) when hiking with a length of \( L = 4.2 \) miles and an altitude gain of \( G = 4000 \) feet using the model \( T = aL + bG \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) first.

Given:
- For \( L = 1.5 \) miles and \( G = 800 \) feet, \( T = 69 \) minutes.
- For \( L = 1.2 \) miles and \( G = 1100 \) feet, \( T = 69 \) minutes.

We can set up the following system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
T_1 = a(1.5) + b(800) = 69 \\
T_2 = a(1.2) + b(1100) = 69
\end{cases}
\]

Let's solve this system step by step.

From the first equation:
\[
1.5a + 800b = 69 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

From the second equation:
\[
1.2a + 1100b = 69 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):
\[
(1.2a + 1100b) - (1.5a + 800b) = 69 - 69
\]
\[
1.2a + 1100b - 1.5a - 800b = 0
\]
\[
-0.3a + 300b = 0
\]

Solving for \( a \) and substituting back into Equation 1:
\[
-0.3a = -300b \\
a = \frac{300}{0.3} b \\
a = 1000b
\]

Now we substitute \( a = 1000b \) into Equation 1 to find \( b \):
\[
1.5(1000b) + 800b = 69
\]
\[
1500b + 800b = 69
\]
\[
2300b = 69 \\
b = \frac{69}{2300}
\]

Now we find \( a \):
\[
a = 1000b = 1000 \times \frac{69}{2300} = \frac{69000}{2300} = \frac{690}{230} = \frac{69}{23}
\]

Now we have \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = \frac{69}{23}, \quad b = \frac{69}{2300}
\]

Using these constants to find \( T \) when \( L = 4.2 \) miles and \( G = 4000 \) feet:
\[
T = aL + bG \\
T = \left(\frac{69}{23}\right)(4.2) + \left(\frac{69}{2300}\right)(4000)
\]

Calculate \( T \):
\[
\left(\frac{69}{23}\right)(4.2) = 69 \times \frac{4.2}{23} \\
= 69 \times \frac{4.2}{23} = 13.8091 \text{ (approx)}
\]

And,
\[
\left(\frac{69}{2300}\right)(4000) = 69 \times \frac{4000}{2300} \\
= 69 \times \frac{40}{23} \\
= 13.8091 \text{ (approx)}
\]

Adding these two:
\[
T = 13.8091 + 13.8091 \\
= 27.6182 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the model estimates it will take approximately \( 27.62 \) minutes to hike up a trail that is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet:
$$
\boxed{27.62}

Q4: To determine the least number of two-digit numbers needed to sum up to 2024, let's analyze and calculate step-by-step.

Firstly, any two-digit number ranges from 10 to 99. We aim to use as few such numbers as possible. 

A good strategy here is considering the largest possible two-digit numbers first since they contribute more to the sum in fewer instances compared to smaller ones.

Let's begin by dividing 2024 by the largest two-digit number, which is 99:

\[
\frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44
\]

This tells us that we can use the number 99 at most 20 times without exceeding 2024 because \(21 \times 99 = 2079 > 2024\). Therefore, using nine nines (which is less than 21) will keep our sum below 2024.

Calculating the total:

\[
20 \times 99 = 1980
\]

Now we need to reach 2024 from 1980. The difference needed is:

\[
2024 - 1980 = 44
\]

Since 44 is a two-digit number, it can be used without exceeding the sum of 2024.

Thus, we have successfully composed the number 2024 using exactly 21 numbers, where one of them is 44 and the rest are 99s. The least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum is:

\[
\boxed{21}

Q7: To find the least possible positive sum of three integers whose product is 60, we need to consider all sets of integers that satisfy the condition \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 60\) and then determine which set has the smallest sum. Let's analyze this systematically.

Firstly, let’s list some factorizations of 60 into three integers:

1. \(5 \times 3 \times 4\)
2. \(-5 \times -3 \times 4\)
3. \(5 \times -3 \times -4\)
4. \(-5 \times 3 \times -4\)

Now, we calculate the sums of these sets:

1. For \(a = 5\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = 4\):
   \[
   a + b + c = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12
   \]

2. For \(-5\), \(-3\), and \(4\):
   \[
   -5 + (-3) + 4 = -8 + 4 = -4
   \]
   This is not positive, so we discard this set.

3. For \(5\), \(-3\), and \(-4\):
   \[
   5 + (-3) + (-4) = 5 - 7 = -2
   \]
   Also not positive.

4. For \(-5\), \(3\), and \(-4\):
   \[
   -5 + 3 + (-4) = -6
   \]
   Also negative, so this set is discarded as well.

So the only valid sets of integers giving a positive sum are:
- \(a=5\), \(b=3\), and \(c=4\) with sum \(12\).

Therefore, the least possible positive sum for three integers whose product is 60 is:

\[
\boxed{12}

Q8: To solve when Daria joined the team, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and track the progress of the workers step by step.

First, let's calculate how much Amy, Bomani, and Charlie had packed until Daria joined:

- Each of them packs at a rate of $3$ packages in every $3$ minutes.
- Therefore, they pack at a combined rate of $3 + 3 + 3 = 9$ packages per $3$ minutes.

Since there are $60$ minutes between 1:00 PM and 2:45 PM, we can determine the number of 3-minute intervals in this period:
$$
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ intervals}
$$

Thus, their total output from 1:00 PM to when Daria joined is:
$$
9 \times 20 = 180 \text{ packages}
$$

Now we know that by the time Daria joined, they had already packed $180$ out of a total of $450$ packages. Therefore, the number of packages remaining after Daria joined is:
$$
450 - 180 = 270 \text{ packages}
$$

Daria joins and packs at a rate of $5$ packages every $4$ minutes. To find how many minutes it took to pack all 270 remaining packages, we use the following calculation:

Since Daria's rate is $5$ packages in $4$ minutes, her combined rate becomes:
$$
\frac{5}{4} \text{ packages per minute}
$$

Now calculate the time taken for Daria to pack $270$ packages:
$$
\text{Time required for Daria to pack 270 packages} = \frac{270}{\frac{5}{4}} = 270 \times \frac{4}{5} = 216 \text{ minutes}
$$

Next, we need to find out when 216 minutes after the initial time of 1:00 PM. Converting $216$ minutes into hours and minutes:
$$
216 \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours and } 16 \text{ minutes}
$$

Adding this to the starting time of 1:00 PM gives us:
$$
1:00 \, \text{PM} + 3 \text{ hours and } 16 \text{ minutes} = 4:16 \, \text{PM}
$$

Therefore, Daria joined the group at:
$$
\boxed{4:16 \text{ PM}}

Q13: To solve for the greatest integer \( M \) such that both \( M + 1213 \) and \( M + 3773 \) are perfect squares, we start by setting:
\[ M + 1213 = a^2 \]
\[ M + 3773 = b^2 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
\[
b^2 - a^2 = 2560
\]

This can be factored as:
\[
(b - a)(b + a) = 2560
\]

We need to find pairs of factors of \( 2560 \):
\[ (1, 2560), (2, 1280), (4, 640), (5, 512), (8, 320), (10, 256), (16, 160), (20, 128), (32, 80), (32, 80) \]

We are looking for integer solutions where both \( b - a \) and \( b + a \) are integers. We'll test the pairs to find suitable values of \( b \) and \( a \).

1. **Testing pair (16, 160):**
   \[
   b - a = 16
   \]
   \[
   b + a = 160
   \]

   Solving these:
   Adding the equations: 
   \[
   2b = 176 \implies b = 88
   \]
   Subtracting the equations:
   \[
   2a = 144 \implies a = 72
   \]

Thus, \( M + 1213 = 72^2 = 5184 \):
\[
M = 5184 - 1213 = 3971
\]

Checking the second condition:
\[
M + 3773 = 3971 + 3773 = 7744
\]
\[
b^2 = 7744 = 88^2 \quad (\text{which is true})
\]

Since \( M = 3971 \) satisfies both conditions, we need to determine the unit digit of \( M \).

The unit digit of \( M = 3971 \) is:
$$
1
$$

Therefore, the unit digit of \( M \) is \(\boxed{1}\). vs 8 | Current Accuracy: 0.0%

Q15: To solve this problem, we need to determine for how many positive integers \( b \) in the range \( 5 \leq b \leq 2024 \), the base-b representation of the decimal number 2024 is divisible by 16. 

The base-b representation of the decimal number 2024 can be understood as follows:
\[ 2024_b = 2b^3 + 0b^2 + 2b + 4 \]

For \( 2024_b \) to be divisible by 16, we must have:
\[ 2b^3 + 2b + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{16} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2b^3 + 2b + 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{16} \]
Dividing the equation by 2, we get:
\[ b^3 + b + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \]

We need to find values of \( b \) that satisfy this congruence for all \( b \) in the range \( 5 \leq b \leq 2024 \). 

Let's solve \( b^3 + b + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \):

1. For \( b = 1, 2, 3, 4 \):
    - If \( b = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 1 + 2 = 4 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
    - If \( b = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 2 + 2 = 12 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
    - If \( b = 3 \): \( 3^3 + 3 + 2 = 26 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
    - If \( b = 4 \): \( 4^3 + 4 + 2 = 70 \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)

Since no values of \( b \) in the range from 1 to 4 satisfy the condition, we need to check for other potential solutions. 

Next, consider \( b \geq 5 \). Let's investigate:
- For any odd \( b \), \( b^3 + b \) will be even and hence not divisible by 8.
- For even \( b \):
    - If \( b = 6 \): \( 6^3 + 6 + 2 = 214 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)
    - If \( b = 8 \): \( 8^3 + 8 + 2 = 522 \equiv 6 \pmod{8} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \)

From the above observations, we conclude that no values of \( b \) in the specified range satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, there are no such \( b \).

Thus, the value of \( K = 0 \), and the sum of its digits is:

\boxed{0}

Q19: To solve this problem, we need to understand how each die roll influences the movement of the bee in the 3D space. The possibilities for each axis (x, y, z) are:

- x-axis rolls can be A+, A-, B+, or B-. This means moving either +1 or -1 along the x-axis.
- y-axis rolls can be B+, B-, C+, or C-. This means moving either +1 or -1 along the y-axis.
- z-axis rolls can be C+, C-. This means moving either +1 or -1 along the z-axis.

A unit cube has 6 faces, each edge of which is one unit long. Since there are 4 edges to traverse and we start at the origin (0,0,0), this implies that the bee needs to visit 4 distinct edges without revisiting any point in space except for possible overlaps due to multiple visits along a single axis.

Given that we have 3 independent die rolls per direction, each roll is independent of others. So, for each coordinate, there are \(2^3 = 8\) potential moves (each face can be traversed).

To traverse exactly 4 distinct edges, the bee must make one complete traversal in two different directions without overlapping points except possibly at the start and end of the move.

Let's compute this probability. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die four times for each coordinate is \(8^4 = 4096\).

For traversing exactly 4 distinct edges, we need to identify valid sequences. Since we are traversing in 3 dimensions (x, y, z), and considering the nature of our movements (positive or negative), it's important to note that any sequence of rolls will result in a net movement where only one edge is uniquely traversed in each direction due to symmetry.

The number of ways to arrange these moves so that exactly four distinct edges are traversed can be computed by choosing 4 out of the possible 6 edges, and then arranging them. This involves combinations and permutations:

$$
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{6}{4} \times 2^4 = 15 \times 16 = 240.
$$

The probability is then calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes:
$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable ways}}{\text{Total number of possible ways}} = \frac{240}{4096}.
$$

This fraction simplifies as follows:

$$
\frac{240}{4096} = \frac{15}{256}.
$$

Therefore, the probability that the bee traverses exactly 4 distinct edges of a unit cube is given by:
$$
\boxed{\frac{15}{256}}
