Q3: Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the smallest prime number (let's call it 'p') that can be expressed as a sum of five distinct prime numbers. 

**2. The Challenge:**

This is a fun mathematical puzzle, and finding 'p' directly might not be the easiest approach.  It involves finding a specific combination of primes and their sum to meet this condition.


**3. Using the Smallest Prime Number (for an Answer):**

Let's consider some prime numbers and think about how many you need for this problem: 
* 2, 3, 5, 7... 

You have 4 choices to start with for our prime number 'p'. For example:
* **5 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 = 18**  (Can be written as a sum of five distinct primes).


Let's see if the small primes meet this condition.

**Therefore, the answer is $0$**

Q4: Here's how to figure out the minimum number of two-digit numbers needed to represent 2024:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the smallest set of two-digit numbers that add up to 2024.

**2. Finding the Numbers:**

* **Finding the Largest Digit:** The largest possible digit for the first place is 9, because we want a sum smaller than 10,000.
* **Testing Combinations:** Try different combinations of two-digit numbers (for example, 89, 90, etc.) and see what sums we can get to 2024. You'll find that you need more than just the numbers 89, 90, 91, etc. 

**3. Calculating the Solution:**
You can use a calculator or program like Python to test this out to find the minimum number of two-digit numbers needed. This is usually easier than figuring it out by trial and error!

Q9: Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Choose the Teams:**

*  The number of ways to choose 3 teams is ⁶C₃ = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20

**2. How many people can be in each team?**

* For each team, we need 2 juniors and 2 seniors. We don't care about the specific order we pick.
* This means there are  ⁶C₂ = (6!)/(2!4!) = 15 ways to choose junior/senior pairs for each team.


**3. Combine the choices:**

Since every student can be in any of the three teams, we have a total number of combinations: 
20 * 15 = **300**

Q10: Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step using modular arithmetic and pattern recognition:

**Understanding the Operation:**

The core logic of the operation lies in reducing 'n' based on its divisibility by 3. Here's a breakdown:

* **Multiple of 3:** If n is divisible by 3, it's reduced to `n/3`.
* **Not a Multiple of 3:**  If n isn't divisible by 3, it's increased by 10 and then the operation continues.


**Pattern Recognition:**

We can use modulo arithmetic (the remainder after division) to simplify our analysis. Let's examine how 'n' changes:

* **Initial state:** n = 100
* **First step:** Since 100 is a multiple of 3, we divide it by 3 to get 33 with a remainder of 1.
    *  We replace n with 33. 


**Iterative Analysis:**

For the sake of simplicity, let's focus on how the operation changes 'n' based on divisibility by 3.  Here's how the process plays out:

1. **Modulo Analysis:** If n is divisible by 3, it goes down to the quotient/3, and modulo-analysis helps us determine how many steps we will need.
2. **Recursive Division & Modulo Reduction:** We can analyze the division based on the modulo analysis. This can be done for all values of 'n'.


**Important Note:**  The exact process requires a deeper understanding of modular arithmetic.

Q11: Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Square both sides:** 
   Squaring both sides of the equation  √(n² - 49) = m gives us:
   n² - 49 = m² 

**2. Analyze the equation:**
   * This means that m² is equal to n² - 49. 
   * Since we're looking for ordered pairs, m and n must be integers.  

**3. Finding integer solutions:**
   * To find possible values of (m, n), consider the squares of positive integers. You can see that for any perfect square (like 16, 25, etc.) you might be able to find a corresponding n², and then test m = the value of n² - 49

**4. Solving by trial-and-error:**
   *  It would be quite tedious to solve this directly, but a helpful method is to use trial-and-error: try substituting different values of m in the equation above and see if you get an integer solution for n² - 49.

**5. Finding the answer**
   * You'll discover that  only specific pairs satisfy this condition (m,n) as a result of your trial and error process.

Q13: Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Perfect Squares:**  A perfect square is an integer that can be obtained by squaring an integer (e.g., 9 is a perfect square because 3 * 3 = 9).
* **Goal:** We need to find the value of 'M' where both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares.

**Finding M**

Let's break it down:

* **Consider the unit digits:**  The units digit of a perfect square is determined by the units digit of the base number. For example, the units digit of 9² = 81 is 1.
* **Focus on the possible unit digits:** If we try some values for M and see if they result in perfect squares, let's see if a pattern emerges:

   -  If M has a unit digit of 1, then (M + 1213) would be a number ending in 4, and (M + 3773) would need to end in a double 9. The possibility here is M = 1.
   - If M has a unit digit of 2, then (M + 1213) would have to end in a double 4, while (M + 3773) needs to end in a double 6, this is not possible.

**The Answer**

* The unit digit of **M = 1**.

Q15: Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the number of bases (b) where 2024*b is divisible by 16. This means that we need a base whose powers of b will leave no remainder when divided by 16.  

**Using Divisibility Rules and Exploring Powers of b**

Let's analyze:

* **Divisibility Rule for 16:** A number is divisible by 16 if its last two digits are divisible by 16. 
* **Powers of b:** Since we need divisibility, let's focus on the units and tens digits when calculating powers of b.  The key to finding a base that satisfies this condition lies in understanding how these digits interact with 16.

**Finding the Solution**

Let's try a few values for b and see if we can find a pattern:

* **b = 8:**  2024*8 is divisible by 16.
* **b = 7:** 2024*7 is not divisible by 16.
* **b = 9:** 2024*9 is not divisible by 16.

...and so on, we need to determine the right number of b values that satisfy this condition.


**Important Note:** To efficiently find all the bases (b) satisfying this condition, we can consider prime factorization and divisibility rules for powers of 2:

* **Factors of 16:** 16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2^4 
* **Finding b values:** We need to find the base (b) that satisfies divisibility by powers of 2.  For example, we'd try bases like 2, 4, 8, 16 and so on.


**Calculating the Sum of Digits**

Once you determine all those 'b' values that meet the criteria, find the sum of their digits.

Q16: Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Geometric Sequences**

A geometric sequence is a list where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the common ratio. 

**The Problem Setup**

We know the first three terms of the sequence are:

*  a (the initial term)
*  720 (the second term)
*  b (the third term)

**Finding the Common Ratio**

To find the common ratio, divide any term by its predecessor. For example: 
720 / a = r  (where 'r' is the common ratio). 

**Finding b to minimize the sum of digits**

* **Understanding the relationship between terms:** We need to find a and b that maximize the difference in their values. 
* **Simplifying the expression:** The goal is to find what makes the sum of the digits of 'b' as small as possible, knowing a < 720 < b.

Q18: Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Manipulate the Equations:**

* **Rearrange the equations:**  Add/subtract terms from each equation to isolate 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 

   Let's use a few examples:
    * **Equation 1 (ab + c = 10):**  Isolate 'c':  c = 10 - ab
    * **Equation 2 (bc + a = 87):** Isolate 'a':  a = 87 - bc
    * **Equation 3 (ca + b = 60):** Isolate 'b': b = 60 - ca

**2. Substitute and Solve:**

* Now that you have individual expressions for 'a', 'b', and 'c' in terms of the others, substitute those values into any of the equations to solve for one variable (let's say 'a') in terms of the other two. 
* **Example:**  Let's use Equation 1 to find 'a':
    *  Substitute: c = 10 - ab
    *   Solve for 'a': a = (10 - c) / b

**3. Simplify and Combine:**

* After finding the expression for 'a', substitute that value back into Equations 2 and 3 to find expressions for 'b' and then for 'c'.
* Once you have values for all three variables, calculate **ab + bc + ca**.

**Important Notes:**  
* This problem involves algebraic manipulation, so be prepared to solve equations involving fractions and exponents.
