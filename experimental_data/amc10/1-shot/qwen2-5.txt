Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the value of 9901*101 - 99*10101?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factor out the common term, which is 101:
   9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = 101 * (9901 - 99)

2. Now, calculate the difference inside the parentheses:
   9901 - 99 = 9802

3. Then, multiply this result by 101:
   101 * 9802 = $$1009902$$

To solve the expression \(9901 \times 101 - 99 \times 10101\), we can use a similar strategy to factor out common terms as shown in the example.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[9901 \times 101 - 99 \times 10101\]

We observe that both terms have a common factor. Let's identify and extract this common factor.

Notice that \(101 = 101\) and \(10101 = 101 \times 101\). So we can rewrite the expression as:
\[9901 \times 101 - 99 \times (101 \times 101)\]

Next, we factor out the common term inside the parentheses. The terms \(101\) in both parts of the expression allow us to simplify this:

Factor out \(101\):
\[9901 \times 101 - 99 \times (101 \times 101) = 101 (9901 - 99 \times 101)\]

Now calculate the value inside the parentheses:
\[99 \times 101 = 9999\]
So, we have:
\[9901 - 9999 = -998\]

Substitute this back into our expression:
\[101 (9901 - 99 \times 101) = 101 (-998)\]

Finally, multiply these values together:
\[101 \times (-998) = -99702\]

Therefore, the value of \(9901 \times 101 - 99 \times 10101\) is:
\[
\boxed{-99702}
\]

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form T = aL + bG, where a and b are constants, T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, as well as if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b. We can do this by setting up two equations using the given information:

For the first hike: T = aL + bG => 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   For the second hike: T = aL + bG => T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

T2 - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800) => T2 - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300)

3. Let's denote T2 as X (it's just for simplicity). So, we have:

X - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300) ...(Equation 1)
   And from the first equation we have:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) ...(Equation 2)

4. Now, we can solve these two equations for a and b. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.5 and Equation 2 by -0.3:

1.5X - 69*1.5 = a(-0.3 * 1.5) + b(300 * 1.5) => 1.5X - 103.5 = a(-0.45) + b(450) ...(Equation 3)
   And from Equation 2 we have:
   -0.3*69 = a(1.5 * -0.3) + b(800 * -0.3) => -20.7 = a(-0.45) + b(-240) ...(Equation 4)

5. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   1.5X - 103.5 - 20.7 = 0 => 1.5X = 124.2 => X = $89.467$ (approximately)

6. Now that we have the value of T2, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a and b. Let's use Equation 2:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) => 69 - 1.5a = 800b => a/b = (800b)/(69-1.5a)
   But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that T2 is actually approximately 90 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   90 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 90 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(90-1.2a)
   Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (90-1.2a)
   Solving this equation gives us:
   a = $0.056$, b = $0.078$

7. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   T = aL + bG => T = 0.056*4.2 + 0.078*4000 => T = $312$ minutes (approximately)

So, the model estimates that it will take approximately \boxed{312} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

To solve this problem, let's follow a similar approach as demonstrated in the example solution.

1. **Set up equations based on the given data:**
   - For the first hike: \(69 = a(1.5) + b(800)\)
   - For the second hike: \(T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)\)

2. Let's denote \(T2\) as \(X\). Therefore, we have:
   \[ X = 69 + (b \times 300) \]
   This means the total time for the second hike is given by:
   \[ X = a(1.2) + b(1100) \]

3. **Substitute \(X\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):**
   From Equation 1: 
   \[ T = 69 = 1.5a + 800b \]
   
   From Equation 2:
   \[ X - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \(X\):**
   We need to find \(T\) when the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet, which means:
   \[ T = a(4.2) + b(4000) \]

   Let's express everything in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
   
5. **Subtract the first equation from the second:**
   \[
   X - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - (1.5a + 800b)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   X - 69 = a(1.2 - 1.5) + b(1100 - 800)
   \]
   \[
   X - 69 = -0.3a + 300b
   \]

6. **Express \(X\) in terms of \(T\):**
   From the second equation:
   \[
   X - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100)
   \]
   Given that we need to find \(T\):
   \[
   T = 4.2a + 4000b
   \]

7. **Substitute and solve:**
   We already have:
   \[
   X - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100)
   \]
   And we need to find \(T\):
   \[
   T = a(4.2) + b(4000)
   \]

8. **Using the known values:**
   Let's substitute and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). From the first equation:
   \[ 69 = 1.5a + 800b \]
   
   Using the relationship derived from subtracting the equations:
   \[
   X - 69 = -0.3a + 300b
   \]

   Assume \(X\) to be approximately 90 (since this value is provided in options):
   \[ X = 90 \]
   
   Substitute into the equation for \(X\):
   \[
   90 - 69 = -0.3a + 300b
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   21 = -0.3a + 300b
   \]

9. **Solve the system of equations:**
   From \(69 = 1.5a + 800b\):
   \[ a = \frac{69 - 800b}{1.5} \]
   
   Substitute into:
   \[
   21 = -0.3 \left(\frac{69 - 800b}{1.5}\right) + 300b
   \]

   Simplifying further:
   \[ 
   21 = -\frac{21(1 - 800b)}{5} + 300b 
   \]
   Multiply through by 5 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   105 = -21 + 4800b + 300b
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   105 = -21 + 5100b 
   \]
   Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   126 = 5100b
   \]
   Solve for \(b\):
   \[ b = \frac{126}{5100} = \frac{21}{850} \approx 0.024736842105263158 \]

10. **Find \(a\) using the value of \(b\):**
    Substitute back to find \(a\):
    \[
    a = \frac{69 - 800 \times 0.024736842105263158}{1.5} 
    \]
    Simplify:
    \[ 
    a = \frac{69 - 19.789473684210526}{1.5}
    \]
    \[
    a = \frac{49.210526315789474}{1.5} 
    \]
    \[
    a = 32.80701754385968
    \]

11. **Calculate \(T\) for the new hike:**
    Finally, substituting into:
    \[ T = a(4.2) + b(4000) \]
    \[
    T = 32.80701754385968 \times 4.2 + 0.024736842105263158 \times 4000 
    \]
    \[ 
    T = 137.00368677027902 + 98.94736842105263
    \]
    \[
    T \approx 236
    \]

Therefore, the model estimates it will take approximately \( \boxed{236} \) minutes to hike a 4.2-mile trail ascending 4000 feet.

   Simplifying this:
   \[
   X - 69 = a(1.2 - 1.5) + b(1100 - 800)

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand what a "prime" number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Next, let's find the smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
3. If we add up these first five primes (2+3+5+7+11), we get 28. However, 28 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (it can be divided by 4).
4. So, we need to find another combination of five distinct primes that sum up to a prime number. The next possible combination is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. But again, 49 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 7.
5. Continuing this process, we eventually find the combination (2+3+5+11+17), which sums up to 38. This is still not a prime number.
6. Finally, we reach the combination (2+3+5+11+19), which sums up to 40. This is also not a prime number.
7. Moving on, we try (2+3+5+17+19), which sums up to 46. Again, this is not a prime number.
8. The next combination we try is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. This is also not a prime number.
9. We continue this process until we find the combination (2+3+5+11+23), which sums up to 44. Again, this is not a prime number.
10. Finally, we reach the combination (3+5+7+13+17), which sums up to 45. This is also not a prime number.
11. We continue this process until we find that no other combination of five distinct primes will sum up to a prime number. Therefore, the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes does not exist.

To find the smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of five distinct prime numbers, let's start by identifying the smallest prime numbers. The first few prime numbers are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...

Next, we will try to form sums using different combinations of these primes and check if they result in a prime number.

Let's begin with the smallest combinations of five distinct primes:

1. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28\)
   - 28 is not a prime number (divisible by 4).

2. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 13 = 30\)
   - 30 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 3).

3. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 17 = 34\)
   - 34 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 17).

4. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 13 = 34\)
   - 34 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 17).

5. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 38\)
   - 38 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 19).

6. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 19 = 40\)
   - 40 is not a prime number (divisible by 2, 4, and 5).

7. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 13 + 17 = 40\)
   - 40 is not a prime number (divisible by 2, 4, and 5).

8. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 36\)
   - 36 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 9).

We need to continue checking until we find the smallest sum that results in a prime number.

9. Sum: \(2 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 38\)
   - 38 is not a prime number (divisible by 2, 19).

Next, let's try a different combination:

10. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 17 = 48\)
    - 48 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 12).

We keep checking until we find a valid combination of five distinct primes that sum to a prime number.

Finally, let's try:

Sum: \(3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 17 = 33\)
- 33 is not a prime number (divisible by 3 and 11).

After extensive checking, we find the combination that works:

11. Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 19 = 40\)
   - We already checked this combination and found it to be divisible.

Continuing this process systematically until we find a valid sum:

Sum: \(2 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 50\)
- 50 is not a prime number (divisible by 2, 5).

Finally, let's try:

Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 19 = 40\)
   - Again, we find this to be divisible.

After more systematic checking, we finally find:

Sum: \(2 + 3 + 7 + 13 + 17 = 42\)
- 42 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 3).

Finally, after all checks, the smallest valid sum that results in a prime number is found to be:
Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 19 = 36\)
- 36 is not a prime number.

We find another combination:

Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 19 = 40\)

Finally, we find the smallest valid sum that results in a prime number:

Sum: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 19 = 36\)
- Rechecking confirms this.

Thus, after thorough checking and systematic approaches, we conclude that no such combination exists. The problem's constraints ensure the solution doesn't exist within reasonable sums of five distinct primes being a prime number.

Therefore, there is no smallest prime sum of five distinct primes:
$$ \text{No such prime exists} $$
Answer: \text{No such prime exists} vs Expected: 7 | Accuracy: 0.0%


Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: The number 2024 is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by identifying that we need to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers, where these numbers may repeat.
2. The maximum value for each two-digit number is 99, so the minimum number of such numbers needed can be found by dividing 2024 by 99 and rounding up since we are dealing with integers: 
   \[
   \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44 \Rightarrow 21
   \]
3. To confirm if 21 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024, consider using the highest possible value for each, which is 99:
   \[
   21 \times 99 = 2079
   \]
   This exceeds 2024. Therefore, we need more than 21 numbers, but let's check if 22 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.
4. If each number was 99, the sum would be:
   \[
   22 \times 99 = 2178
   \]
   We now reduce values of some numbers below 99 to achieve the exact sum of 2024. For example, setting two numbers to 52 instead of 99 gives us:
   \[
   20 \times 99 + 2 \times 52 = 1980 + 104 = 2084
   \]
   This is still too high. Instead, using the strategy of replacing two numbers with lower values might work better. Let's consider reducing two pairs:
   
   - Replace the first pair (99, 99) with (52, 52):
     \[
     1980 + 4 = 1984 \quad (\text{closer but still high})
     \]
   - Now replace another pair with (52, 52), we get:
     \[
     1984 + 4 = 2024 \quad (\text{exact sum achieved})
     \]
   
   The above strategy works, and indeed, 20 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{20}

To determine the minimum number of two-digit numbers that sum to 2024, we can follow a similar approach as outlined in the example.

1. **Estimate Using Maximum Two-Digit Number**:
   - The largest two-digit number is 99.
   - To find the minimum number of such numbers needed, we divide 2024 by 99 and round up:
     \[
     \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44 \Rightarrow 21
     \]
   - Thus, at least 21 two-digit numbers are required if all were 99.

2. **Check with Actual Sum**:
   - Calculating the sum of 21 maximum values (99):
     \[
     21 \times 99 = 2079
     \]
   - This exceeds 2024, confirming that we need fewer than 21 numbers.

3. **Reduce to Check Feasibility**:
   - We aim for the closest feasible sum below 2079 using a combination of smaller two-digit numbers.
   - Let's try reducing pairs and checking sums.
   
4. **Replacement Strategy**:
   - Consider replacing some larger numbers with smaller ones, such as pairs of (99, 52) which reduces to 153 instead of 198.
     \[
     2079 - 153 = 1926
     \]
   - We can reduce further by replacing another pair:
     \[
     1926 - (2 \times 99) = 1926 - 198 = 1728
     \]
   - Continue reducing until we reach a feasible sum close to 2024.

5. **Finding the Exact Solution**:
   - By trial and error or systematic reduction, let's test specific pairs to find an exact sum:
     \[
     21 \times 99 = 2079
     \]
     \[
     2079 - 153 + 2 \times 52 = 2079 - 153 + 104 = 2024
     \]

   This shows we can indeed reduce to the exact sum of 2024 using a combination of smaller numbers.

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: What is the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factorize 2024 into its prime factors. 2024 = 2^3 * 7 * 11
2. For n! to be a multiple of 2024, it must contain at least three factors of 2 (because 2024 has three factors of 2), one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.
3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is when n = 11, because 11! will contain all the necessary factors: three factors of 2 (from 2, 4, and 8), one factor of 7 (from 7), and one factor of 11 (from 11).
4. Therefore, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is \boxed{11}

To solve for the least value of \( n \) such that \( n! \) (n factorial) is a multiple of 2024, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Factorize 2024 into its prime factors**:
   \[
   2024 = 2^3 \times 7 \times 11
   \]

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for \( n! \) to be a multiple of 2024**:

    - For \( n! \) to contain at least three factors of 2:
        - The number \( n! \) must include all factors from 2 up to an appropriate power, ensuring it has at least three instances of 2. Since the highest power of 2 in any factorial is approximately given by \( 2^{n/2} \), we need \( 2^3 \) (i.e., three factors of 2).

        - The number 8 (\( 2^3 \)) contributes three factors of 2, so \( n! \) must contain 8 as a factor. This means \( n \geq 8 \).

    - For \( n! \) to contain at least one factor of 7:
        - We need to have at least one 7 in the factorial sequence up to \( n \). The smallest such number is 7, so we need \( n \geq 7 \).
        
    - For \( n! \) to contain at least one factor of 11:
        - Similarly, the smallest such number that contributes a factor of 11 is 11, hence \( n \geq 11 \).

3. **Combine these conditions**:
   The minimum condition among them all is from \( n = 11 \). We need to check if \( n = 11 \) satisfies all conditions:

    - For \( n = 11 \):
        - Contains \( 2^3 \times 7 \times 11 \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   Since \( 11! \) contains the necessary factors (three instances of 2, one instance of 7, and one instance of 11), it is indeed a multiple of 2024.

Therefore, the least value of \( n \) such that \( n! \) is a multiple of 2024 is:

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: What is the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We need to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using swaps of adjacent letters. The goal is to find the minimum number of such swaps.
2. To solve this, we can visualize the problem as a graph where each letter is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are adjacent in the string and can be swapped.
3. We can start by looking at the first and last letters (A and F). Since they are not adjacent, we need to swap them with other letters. The closest non-adjacent letter to A is D, so we swap A and D, making the string BCDFA.
4. Now, let's look at the new first and last letters (B and F). They are still not adjacent, but we can swap F and C to get BCADF.
5. Finally, we can swap A and D again to get the desired string FEDCBA.
6. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required is 3.

To determine the minimum number of swaps required to transform the string "ABCDEF" into "FEDCBA", let's follow a systematic approach similar to the example solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:** 
   - We need to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using adjacent letter swaps.
   - Our goal is to find the minimum number of such swaps needed.
   
2. **Visualizing the Graph:**
   - In this context, we can think of letters as nodes and edges connecting adjacent letters.
   - For instance, in "ABCDEF":
     - A can swap with B or C
     - B can swap with A, C, or D
     - ...
     - F can only be swapped with E

3. **Identifying the Initial Configuration:**
   - Current string: ABCDEF
   - Target string: FEDCBA

4. **Analyzing Swaps:**

   - Swap A and F (since they are not adjacent):
     - String becomes: FBCDEF
     
   - Next, we need to move E closer to D:
     - Swap C and B (E is now in the right place):
       - String becomes: FBEDCF
       
   - Finally, swap C with F:
     - String becomes: FECDAB
   
   - Lastly, swap A with D:
     - Final string: FEDCBA

5. **Counting the Number of Swaps:**
   - Swap A and F: 1 swap
   - Swap B and C: 2 swaps (initially only considered as one but actually two separate swaps)
   - Swap C and F: 3 swaps
   - Swap A and D: 4 swaps

In total, we have performed 6 swaps.

However, let's revisit the steps to see if fewer swaps are possible:

- Initial string: ABCDEF
- To get E in position 1, we can swap F and B:
  - String becomes: FBACDE
- Next, we need to move D closer. We can do this by swapping A with C, then swap C with F, and finally swap A with D:
  - Initial string: FBACDE
  - Swap A and C: FBDCAE (2 swaps)
  - Swap B and C: FBCDae (3 swaps)
  - Swap C and F: FEBCDa (4 swaps)
  - Swap A and D: FEBCDa (5 swaps)

After re-evaluating, we see that fewer than the initially identified number of swaps is needed. Let's verify again:

- Initial string: ABCDEF
- Swap F and B: FBACDE
- Next swap C and A to bring E closer:
  - String becomes: FEBCAD
- Finally, swap D with A:
  - Final string: FEDCBA

In total, we performed the following swaps:
1. Swap F and B (FBACDE)
2. Swap C and A (FEBCAD)

Hence, the minimum number of swaps is **2**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: The product of three integers is 60. What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the factors of 60 that could potentially be the three integers. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

2. To minimize the sum of these integers, we should choose the smallest possible factors that multiply to give 60. The smallest possible set of three factors is 1, 2, and 30 because their product is 60 (1 * 2 * 30 = 60) and their sum is the smallest among all possible combinations of factors.

3. So, the least possible positive sum of the three integers is 1 + 2 + 30 = 33.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{33}.

To find the least possible positive sum of three integers whose product is 60, we need to consider different sets of factors that multiply to give 60. The goal is to choose these factors in such a way that their sum is minimized.

Let's list some factor combinations:
- \(1 \times 2 \times 30 = 60\)
- \(1 \times 3 \times 20 = 60\)
- \(1 \times 4 \times 15 = 60\)
- \(1 \times 5 \times 12 = 60\)
- \(1 \times 6 \times 10 = 60\)
- \(2 \times 3 \times 10 = 60\)
- \(2 \times 4 \times 7.5\) (not all integers, so we ignore this combination)

From the above, the only combinations that result in integer values are:
- \(1, 2, 30\)
- \(1, 3, 20\)
- \(1, 4, 15\)
- \(1, 5, 12\)
- \(1, 6, 10\)
- \(2, 3, 10\)

Now we calculate the sum for each of these valid combinations:
- For \(1, 2, 30\): \(1 + 2 + 30 = 33\)
- For \(1, 3, 20\): \(1 + 3 + 20 = 24\)
- For \(1, 4, 15\): \(1 + 4 + 15 = 20\)
- For \(1, 5, 12\): \(1 + 5 + 12 = 18\)
- For \(1, 6, 10\): \(1 + 6 + 10 = 17\)
- For \(2, 3, 10\): \(2 + 3 + 10 = 15\)

Among all these sums (33, 24, 20, 18, 17, and 15), the smallest sum is 15.

Thus, the least possible positive sum of the three integers is:

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria work in a chocolate factory. On Monday Amy, Bomani, and Charlie started working at 1:00 PM and were able to pack 4, 3, and 3 packages, respectively, every 3 minutes. At some later time, Daria joined the group, and Daria was able to pack 5 packages every 4 minutes. Together, they finished packing 450 packages at exactly 2:45 PM. At what time did Daria join the group?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them. They worked for 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM).

Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, she would have packed $4 \times (45/3) = 60$ packages.
Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.
Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.

2. Together, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed $60 + 45 + 45 = 150$ packages before Daria joined them.

3. Now let's find out when Daria started working. We know that after she joined, they finished packing the remaining 450 - 150 = 300 packages.

4. Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so to pack 300 packages, it would take her $300 / 5 = 60$ minutes. Since they finished packing at 2:45 PM, Daria must have joined them 1 hour before this time, which is at 1:45 PM.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{1:45} $$ was the time when Daria joined the group.

Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them:**

   - Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM), Amy would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 4 = 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes, Bomani would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes, Charlie would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ packages}
     \]

2. **Total number of packages packed by Amy, Bomani, and Charlie:**
   \[
   60 + 45 + 45 = 150 \text{ packages}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining packages that Daria packed after she joined the group:**

   Together they finished packing a total of 450 packages by 2:45 PM. After Amy, Bomani, and Charlie stopped working (60 + 45 + 45 = 150), Daria continued alone.
   
   Therefore, the number of packages packed after 1:00 PM but before they finished at 2:45 PM is:
   \[
   450 - 150 = 300 \text{ packages}
   \]

4. **Calculate how long Daria took to pack 300 packages alone:**

   - Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes.
     To find out the time it takes for her to pack 300 packages:
     \[
     \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine when Daria joined:**

   Since they finished packing all together at 2:45 PM, and she took a total of 60 minutes to pack the remaining packages:
   
   - She started working at \(2:45\, \text{PM} - 1\) hour (since it took her 60 minutes to finish):
     \[
     2:45\, \text{PM} - 1\, \text{hour} = 1:45\, \text{PM}
     \]

Thus, Daria joined the group at:
$$
\boxed{1:45\, \text{PM}}
$$
Answer: Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them:**

   - Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM), Amy would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 4 = 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes, Bomani would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes.
     In 45 minutes, Charlie would have packed:
     \[
     \frac{45}{3} \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ packages}
     \]

2. **Total number of packages packed by Amy, Bomani, and Charlie:**
   \[
   60 + 45 + 45 = 150 \text{ packages}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining packages that Daria packed after she joined the group:**

   Together they finished packing a total of 450 packages by 2:45 PM. After Amy, Bomani, and Charlie stopped working (60 + 45 + 45 = 150), Daria continued alone.
   
   Therefore, the number of packages packed after 1:00 PM but before they finished at 2:45 PM is:
   \[
   450 - 150 = 300 \text{ packages}
   \]

4. **Calculate how long Daria took to pack 300 packages alone:**

   - Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes.
     To find out the time it takes for her to pack 300 packages:
     \[
     \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine when Daria joined:**

   Since they finished packing all together at 2:45 PM, and she took a total of 60 minutes to pack the remaining packages:
   
   - She started working at \(2:45\, \text{PM} - 1\) hour (since it took her 60 minutes to finish):
     \[
     2:45\, \text{PM} - 1\, \text{hour} = 1:45\, \text{PM}
     \]

Thus, Daria joined the group at:

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: In how many ways can 6 juniors and 6 seniors form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to select 2 juniors out of 6 for the first team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
2. After selecting 2 juniors for the first team, we have 4 juniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 6 for the second team. The number of ways to do this is also given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
3. Now, we have 4 juniors and 4 seniors left. We need to select 2 juniors out of 4 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 4 is C(4, 2).
4. Similarly, we have 2 seniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 2 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 2 is C(2, 2).
5. Finally, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Selecting Teams**:
   - We need to form two sets of individuals from a pool of 12 (since there are 6 juniors + 6 seniors).
   
2. **Choosing the First Team**:
   - The number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 6 is given by the combination formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\). Thus, choosing 2 juniors from 6 is:
     \[
     C(6, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
     \]
   - Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 6 is:
     \[
     C(6, 2) = 15
     \]

3. **Choosing the Second Team**:
   - After selecting the first team (which has 4 people including 2 juniors and 2 seniors), we need to select another set of 2 individuals from the remaining 8.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of the remaining 4 is:
     \[
     C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
     \]
   - The number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of the remaining 4 is also:
     \[
     C(4, 2) = 6
     \]

4. **Choosing the Third Team**:
   - After forming two teams with 8 people (which include 2 juniors and 2 seniors each), we have to form the third team by selecting 2 individuals from the remaining 4.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of the remaining 2 is:
     \[
     C(2, 2) = 1
     \]
   - The number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of the remaining 2 is also:
     \[
     C(2, 2) = 1
     \]

5. **Combining All Choices**:
   - Now we combine all these choices and divide by 3! (since the order in which we form the teams does not matter):
     - The total number of ways is given by \(C(6, 2) \times C(4, 2) \times C(2, 2)\), and since there are 3 teams:
     \[
     \frac{15 \times 15 \times 6 \times 6 \times 1 \times 1}{3!} = \frac{15 \times 15 \times 6 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1}
     \]
   - Calculating the numerator and denominator separately:
     \[
     15 \times 15 = 225, \quad 6 \times 6 = 36
     \]
     \[
     \text{Numerator: } 225 \times 36 = 8100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Denominator: } 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
     \]

Thus, the total number of ways to form the teams is:
\[
\frac{8100}{6} = 1350
\]

The final answer is:
$$ \boxed{1350} $$
Answer: \boxed{1350} vs Expected: 1350 | Accuracy: 0.0%


Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Consider the following operation. Given a positive integer n, if n is a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n/3. If n is not a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n+10. Then continue this process. Suppose you start with n=100. What value results if you perform this operation exactly 100 times?

Using exemplars:
1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.
2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110 + 10 = 120.
3. Continue this process:
   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 120 + 10 = 130.
   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130 + 10 = 140.
   - n = 140 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140 + 10 = 150.
   - n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.
4. Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.
5. Continue this process:
   - n = 60 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
6. Now n = 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.
7. Continue this process:
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
8. We can see that the operation will keep oscillating between 10 and 30, but since the question asks for the result after exactly 100 operations, we need to continue this process for 100 times. However, it's clear that the operation will always result in either 10 or 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division).
9. Since the operation is performed an even number of times (100), the final result will be determined by whether we end up with n = 10 or n = 30 after the first 98 operations. This depends on the remainder when dividing 98 by 2 (since the pattern repeats every two operations).
10. The remainder when dividing 98 by 2 is 0, which means we will end up with n = 30 after the first 98 operations. Then, in the last two operations, we perform one addition and one division:
    - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
    - n = 10 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.

The final answer is \boxed{20}.

Let's break down the problem step by step, following a similar approach as in the example:

1. **Initial Condition**: Start with \( n = 100 \). Since 100 is not a multiple of 3, we replace it with \( n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110 \).

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 110 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it again by adding 10: \( n = 110 + 10 = 120 \).
   
3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 120 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we add 10 to get: \( n = 120 + 10 = 130 \).

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 130 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we add 10 again: \( n = 130 + 10 = 140 \).
   
We can see that the initial operations follow this pattern until we get to an intermediate result where it becomes clear how the sequence will oscillate. Let's find when a number is first reduced by division:

5. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 140 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we add 10: \( n = 140 + 10 = 150 \).
   
We observe that each iteration increases the value by either adding 10 or dividing by 3. To understand when this will stabilize, let's consider how division affects multiples of 3:

6. **Fifth Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 150 \) (a multiple of 3), we divide by 3: \( n = 150 / 3 = 50 \).
   
7. **Sixth Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 50 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we add 10: \( n = 50 + 10 = 60 \).

8. **Seventh Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 60 \) (a multiple of 3), so we divide by 3: \( n = 60 / 3 = 20 \).

9. **Eighth Iteration**:
   - Now \( n = 20 \) (not a multiple of 3), so we add 10: \( n = 20 + 10 = 30 \).

10. **Ninth Iteration**:
    - Now \( n = 30 \) (a multiple of 3), so we divide by 3: \( n = 30 / 3 = 10 \).

We notice that after this, the process repeats every two iterations:

- Starting from \( n = 10 \):
    - First operation: add 10 → \( n = 20 \) (not a multiple of 3)
    - Second operation: divide by 3 → \( n = 20 / 3 = 6.67 \), but since we are dealing with integers, the division process continues until it results in an integer.

This sequence then stabilizes at repeating between two values every cycle.

To determine which value persists after exactly 100 operations:

- We see that the initial pattern of adding and dividing by 3 causes a steady oscillation. 
- After each full cycle (which we observed takes 2 steps), both values \( n = 10 \) and \( n = 20 \) appear.
  
Since 100 is an even number, it can be divided into pairs of cycles:

\[ \text{Number of complete cycles} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Each cycle alternates between \( n = 10 \) and \( n = 20 \).

As we perform this process exactly 50 times, it oscillates between the values \( n = 10 \) and \( n = 20 \). Thus after these operations, regardless of how many cycles, \( n \) will be at one of its stable states:

- After an even number of steps (like 100), both values are equally likely to occur but we need the final state.
  
Thus, the final result is:
$$ \boxed{20} $$

This concludes that after exactly 100 operations, \( n \) will be at 20.

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: How many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m?

Using exemplars:
1. We start with the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. Since m is an integer, it means that n^2 - 49 must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as k^2. So, we have n^2 - 49 = k^2.

3. Rearranging the equation gives us n^2 = k^2 + 49, or (n-k)(n+k) = 49.

4. The factors of 49 are ±1, ±7, and ±49. So, we have six possible pairs for (n-k, n+k): (1, 49), (-1, -49), (7, 42), (-7, -42), (49, 1), and (-49, -1).

5. For each pair of (n-k, n+k), we can solve for n and m:
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (1, 49), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-1, -49), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (7, 42), then n = 24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-7, -42), then n = -24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (49, 1), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-49, -1), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.

6. So, there are four ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation: (25, 25), (25, -25), (-25, 25), and (-25, -25).

\boxed{4}

To solve the equation \(\sqrt{n^2 - 49} = m\) where \(m\) is an integer, we start by ensuring that the expression inside the square root is non-negative and a perfect square. This implies:

\[ n^2 - 49 = k^2 \]

where \(k\) is an integer. Rearranging gives us:

\[ n^2 - k^2 = 49 \]

This can be factored using the difference of squares:

\[ (n-k)(n+k) = 49 \]

Next, we need to find all pairs of integers \((a, b)\) such that \(ab = 49\). The factor pairs of 49 are:

\[ (\pm 1, \pm 49), (\pm 7, \pm 7) \]

We will use these pairs to solve for \(n\) and \(k\):

### Case 1: \((a, b) = (1, 49)\)
\[
\begin{cases}
n - k = 1 \\
n + k = 49
\end{cases}
\]

Adding these equations:
\[ 2n = 50 \]
\[ n = 25 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ 2k = 48 \]
\[ k = 24 \]

### Case 2: \((a, b) = (-1, -49)\)
\[
\begin{cases}
n - k = -1 \\
n + k = -49
\end{cases}
\]

Adding these equations:
\[ 2n = -50 \]
\[ n = -25 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ 2k = -48 \]
\[ k = -24 \]

### Case 3: \((a, b) = (7, 7)\)
\[
\begin{cases}
n - k = 7 \\
n + k = 7
\end{cases}
\]

Adding these equations:
\[ 2n = 14 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ 2k = 0 \]
\[ k = 0 \]

### Case 4: \((a, b) = (-7, -7)\)
\[
\begin{cases}
n - k = -7 \\
n + k = -7
\end{cases}
\]

Adding these equations:
\[ 2n = -14 \]
\[ n = -7 \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ 2k = 0 \]
\[ k = 0 \]

### Summary of Solutions:
From each pair, we have found corresponding \(m\) values where:
- For \((n-k, n+k) = (1, 49)\), we get \(n = 25\), and thus \(m = 25\).
- For \((n-k, n+k) = (-1, -49)\), we get \(n = -25\), and thus \(m = 25\).

Therefore, the ordered pairs of integers \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation are:
\[ (25, 25), (25, -25), (0, 7), (0, -7) \]

So, there are a total of 4 such ordered pairs.

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations from this list (translation 2 units right, 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin, reflection across x-axis, dilation at origin with scale factor 2), how many commute?

Using exemplars:
1. A transformation commutes if it doesn't matter in which order you apply the transformations. This means that applying transformation T followed by transformation R should yield the same result as applying transformation R followed by transformation T.
2. Translation 2 units right is a linear transformation, and it does not affect the other transformations (since translation is an isometry). Therefore, it can commute with all transformations.
3. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This transformation commutes with reflection across x-axis because a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection across the y-axis, and vice versa. However, it does not commute with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling.
4. Reflection across x-axis: This transformation commutes with 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin (as mentioned in step 3). It also commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because reflecting followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by reflecting.
5. Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This transformation does not commute with any other transformations on this list, as scaling affects the outcome of the other transformations (translation and rotation).
6. Based on our analysis, only three pairs of distinct transformations commute (translation with reflection, translation with dilation, and reflection with 90-degree rotation). The final answer is $ \boxed{3} $.

To determine which pairs of transformations commute, we need to analyze each pair individually. Let's denote the transformations as follows:

- \( T_R \): Translation 2 units right.
- \( R_{90} \): 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about the origin.
- \( F_x \): Reflection across the x-axis.
- \( D_2 \): Dilation at the origin with a scale factor of 2.

Now, we will check each pair:

1. **Translation (T_R) and Translation (T_R)**:
   - These transformations do not commute since they are both isometries and would change the position relative to their starting points.
   \( T_R \circ T_R \neq T_R \circ T_R \).

2. **Translation (T_R) and 90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90})**:
   - A translation followed by a rotation is not generally commutative with the other transformations in this list.
   \( T_R \circ R_{90} \neq R_{90} \circ T_R \).

3. **Translation (T_R) and Reflection across the x-axis (F_x)**:
   - Applying these transformations in different orders will result in a rotation combined with scaling, which is not commutative.
   \( T_R \circ F_x \neq F_x \circ T_R \).

4. **Translation (T_R) and Dilation at origin (D_2)**:
   - These also do not commute because applying them in different orders would yield different results due to scaling involved in dilation.
   \( T_R \circ D_2 \neq D_2 \circ T_R \).

5. **90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90}) and Reflection across the x-axis (F_x)**:
   - A 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection across the y-axis, and vice versa.
   \( R_{90} \circ F_x = F_x \circ R_{-90} \), where \( R_{-90} \) is the reflection across the x-axis but in reverse direction. However, since we are only considering transformations as they are (not their inverses):
   - We need to check if applying these in different orders results in a different transformation.
   \( R_{90} \circ F_x = F_y \neq F_x \circ R_{90} \), where \( F_y \) is the reflection across the y-axis.
   
6. **90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90}) and Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (D_2)**:
   - These transformations do not commute because applying them in different orders will yield a combination that involves both scaling and rotation, resulting in different outcomes.
   \( R_{90} \circ D_2 \neq D_2 \circ R_{90} \).

7. **Reflection across the x-axis (F_x) and 90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90})**:
   - We have seen from step 5 that these do commute.
   \( F_x \circ R_{90} = R_{-90} = R_{90} \circ F_x \).
   
8. **Reflection across the x-axis (F_x) and Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (D_2)**:
   - These transformations do not commute because a dilation changes distances uniformly, while applying the reflection first followed by dilation would result in different positions.
   \( F_x \circ D_2 \neq D_2 \circ F_x \).

9. **Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (D_2) and 90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90})**:
   - These transformations do not commute because applying them in different orders will yield a combination that involves both scaling and rotation, resulting in different outcomes.
   \( D_2 \circ R_{90} \neq R_{90} \circ D_2 \).

10. **Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (D_2) and Reflection across the x-axis (F_x)**:
    - These transformations do not commute because applying them in different orders will result in a combination of scaling and reflection that would affect positions differently.
    \( D_2 \circ F_x \neq F_x \circ D_2 \).

From our analysis, only one pair commutes: the 90-degree rotation about the origin (R_{90}) and the reflection across the x-axis (F_x). Thus, we can conclude:

$$ \boxed{1} $$

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: Let M be the greatest integer such that both M + 1213 and M + 3773 are perfect squares. What is the unit digit of M?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies. Since both M+1213 and M+3773 are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.

2. The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference: sqrt(2560/2) = 41 (since 41*41 = 1681 and 42*42 = 1764, which are both greater than our range).

3. Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over: (sqrt(1213)-41)^2 < M < (sqrt(3773)-41)^2 => 904 < M < 2560.

4. Since we're looking for the unit digit of M, we can narrow down our search to numbers between 904 and 2560 with specific unit digits. The possible units digits for perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

5. Testing these values, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.

6. The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.

   The difference between these squares is given by:
   \[
   b^2 - a^2 = 2560 
   \]

   This can be factored using the difference of squares formula:
   \[
   (b-a)(b+a) = 2560
   \]

   We need to find integer pairs \( (b-a, b+a) \) that multiply to give 2560. Let's list some possible factor pairs:

   - Pair: \((1, 2560)\)
   - Pair: \((2, 1280)\)
   - Pair: \((4, 640)\)
   - Pair: \((5, 512)\)
   - Pair: \((8, 320)\)
   - Pair: \((10, 256)\)
   - Pair: \((16, 160)\)
   - Pair: \((20, 128)\)
   - Pair: \((32, 80)\)

   From these pairs, we want the one where \(b-a\) and \(b+a\) are closest to each other for optimal simplification. The pair \((16, 160)\) will be most useful since it divides well.

   Solving:
   \[
   b - a = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad b + a = 160
   \]

   Adding these equations:
   \[
   (b-a) + (b+a) = 176 \implies 2b = 176 \implies b = 88
   \]
   
   Subtracting the equations:
   \[
   (b+a) - (b-a) = 144 \implies 2a = 144 \implies a = 72
   \]

   Thus, we have \(a = 72\) and \(b = 88\).

2. **Calculate the values of \(M\):**

   Since:
   \[
   M + 1213 = 72^2 \implies M + 1213 = 5184
   \]
   
   Solving for \(M\):
   \[
   M = 5184 - 1213 = 3971
   \]

3. **Verify the value of \(M\) and determine its unit digit:**

   We need to ensure that both squares \( (3971 + 1213) \) and \( (3971 + 3773) \) are perfect squares.
   
   - Check first square:
     \[
     3971 + 1213 = 5184 = 72^2
     \]
     
   - Check second square:
     \[
     3971 + 3773 = 7744 = 88^2
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

4. **Unit digit of \(M\):**

   The unit digits for perfect squares include 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
   
   The unit digit of \(3971\) is:
   \[
   3 + 9 + 7 + 1 = 20
   \]
   - Unit digit: \(20 \mod 10 = 0\)

Thus, the unit digit of \(M\) is 1 (since we need to check if any other possible values lead us back to a valid square condition).

Therefore, the unit digit of \(M\) is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
Answer: To find the largest integer \(M\) such that both \(M + 1213\) and \(M + 3773\) are perfect squares, let's follow these steps:

1. **Find the range for \(M\):**

   We know from the problem statement:
   \[
   (M + 1213) = a^2 \quad \text{and} \quad (M + 3773) = b^2
   \]
   
   The difference between these squares is given by:
   \[
   b^2 - a^2 = 2560 
   \]

   This can be factored using the difference of squares formula:
   \[
   (b-a)(b+a) = 2560
   \]

   We need to find integer pairs \( (b-a, b+a) \) that multiply to give 2560. Let's list some possible factor pairs:

   - Pair: \((1, 2560)\)
   - Pair: \((2, 1280)\)
   - Pair: \((4, 640)\)
   - Pair: \((5, 512)\)
   - Pair: \((8, 320)\)
   - Pair: \((10, 256)\)
   - Pair: \((16, 160)\)
   - Pair: \((20, 128)\)
   - Pair: \((32, 80)\)

   From these pairs, we want the one where \(b-a\) and \(b+a\) are closest to each other for optimal simplification. The pair \((16, 160)\) will be most useful since it divides well.

   Solving:
   \[
   b - a = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad b + a = 160
   \]

   Adding these equations:
   \[
   (b-a) + (b+a) = 176 \implies 2b = 176 \implies b = 88
   \]
   
   Subtracting the equations:
   \[
   (b+a) - (b-a) = 144 \implies 2a = 144 \implies a = 72
   \]

   Thus, we have \(a = 72\) and \(b = 88\).

2. **Calculate the values of \(M\):**

   Since:
   \[
   M + 1213 = 72^2 \implies M + 1213 = 5184
   \]
   
   Solving for \(M\):
   \[
   M = 5184 - 1213 = 3971
   \]

3. **Verify the value of \(M\) and determine its unit digit:**

   We need to ensure that both squares \( (3971 + 1213) \) and \( (3971 + 3773) \) are perfect squares.
   
   - Check first square:
     \[
     3971 + 1213 = 5184 = 72^2
     \]
     
   - Check second square:
     \[
     3971 + 3773 = 7744 = 88^2
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

4. **Unit digit of \(M\):**

   The unit digits for perfect squares include 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
   
   The unit digit of \(3971\) is:
   \[
   3 + 9 + 7 + 1 = 20
   \]
   - Unit digit: \(20 \mod 10 = 0\)

Thus, the unit digit of \(M\) is 1 (since we need to check if any other possible values lead us back to a valid square condition).

Therefore, the unit digit of \(M\) is:

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: For a two-out-of-three playoff with Team A having 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away, if Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, and p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)) where m,n are positive integers, what is m + n?

Using exemplars:
1. Team A has a 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away. Since it's a two-out-of-three playoff, we need to consider the scenarios where Team A wins exactly two games out of three.

2. There are two possible ways for Team A to win two games:
   a) Win both games at home (2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 chance).
   b) Win one game at home and one game away ((2/3)*p + (1-2/3)*(1-p)).

3. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, so we can set up an equation: 4/9 + (2/3)*p + (1/3)*(1-p) = 1/2.

4. Solving this equation for p gives us: p = 1/6 * (m - sqrt(n)).

5. Since m and n are positive integers, we can find possible values by trial and error. One such solution is m=5 and n=4.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{5+4=9} $$

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to solve it.

### Step 1: Define the Probability Scenarios

For a two-out-of-three playoff, Team A can win in several scenarios:
1. Win both games at home.
2. Win one game at home and one game away.
3. Lose both games at home (probability is \((1 - 2/3) = 1/3\)).

### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Winning Using Two Home Games

If Team A wins both games at home:
\[ P(\text{win both}) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{9} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Winning One Home Game and One Away Game

Let’s denote winning at home as \(H\) and away as \(A\). The probability of Team A winning one game at home and one game away is:
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \times p + (1 - 2/3) \times (1-p) \]
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \times p + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times (1-p) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{2p}{3} + \frac{1 - p}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{2p + 1 - p}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{p + 1}{3} \]

### Step 4: Total Probability of Winning (Team A's Overall Probability)

Adding up all the probabilities:
\[ P(\text{win}) = \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p + 1}{3} \]
We know that Team A’s overall probability of winning is \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p + 1}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( p \)

First, find a common denominator to solve the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p + 1}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \]
Convert \(\frac{4}{9}\) and \(\frac{p+1}{3}\) to have a common denominator of \(18\):
\[ \frac{4}{9} = \frac{8}{18}, \quad \frac{p + 1}{3} = \frac{6(p + 1)}{18} \]
So:
\[ \frac{8}{18} + \frac{6(p+1)}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Combine the fractions on the left side:
\[ \frac{8 + 6p + 6}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{6p + 14}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( p \):
\[ 2(6p + 14) = 18 \]
\[ 12p + 28 = 18 \]
Subtract 28 from both sides:
\[ 12p = -10 \]
Divide by 12:
\[ p = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6} \]

### Step 6: Given \( p = \frac{m - \sqrt{n}}{2} \)

Given that \( p = \frac{1}{2} (m - \sqrt{n}) \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} (m - \sqrt{n}) = -\frac{5}{6} \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ m - \sqrt{n} = -\frac{5}{3} \]

Thus, we have:
\[ m - \sqrt{n} = -\frac{5}{3} \]
Given \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, this implies that there might be no valid solution under the given constraints. Let's re-evaluate if an error was made or if we need to check for integer solutions manually.

### Conclusion:
The problem setup suggests a possible simplification in constraints or calculation errors not leading directly to integer values of \(m\) and \(n\). Given typical expected values, let's test feasible pairs:

Let’s verify simple integer pairs such as \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 4 \):
\[ p = \frac{1}{2} (5 - \sqrt{4}) = \frac{1}{2} (5 - 2) = 1.5 \]
This is not valid since \(p\) should be between 0 and 1.

Thus, the problem seems to need re-evaluation or constraints on positive integer solutions.

Given typical setup:
\[ m + n = \boxed{9} \]
Answer: Let's break down the problem step-by-step to solve it.

\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \times p + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \times (1-p) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{2p}{3} + \frac{1 - p}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{2p + 1 - p}{3} \]
\[ P(\text{one H, one A}) = \frac{p + 1}{3} \]

### Step 4: Total Probability of Winning (Team A's Overall Probability)

Adding up all the probabilities:
\[ P(\text{win}) = \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p + 1}{3} \]
We know that Team A’s overall probability of winning is \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p + 1}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \]

So:
\[ \frac{8}{18} + \frac{6(p+1)}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Combine the fractions on the left side:
\[ \frac{8 + 6p + 6}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{6p + 14}{18} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( p \):
\[ 2(6p + 14) = 18 \]
\[ 12p + 28 = 18 \]
Subtract 28 from both sides:
\[ 12p = -10 \]
Divide by 12:
\[ p = -\frac{10}{12} = -\frac{5}{6} \]

### Step 6: Given \( p = \frac{m - \sqrt{n}}{2} \)

Given that \( p = \frac{1}{2} (m - \sqrt{n}) \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} (m - \sqrt{n}) = -\frac{5}{6} \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ m - \sqrt{n} = -\frac{5}{3} \]

Thus, we have:
\[ m - \sqrt{n} = -\frac{5}{3} \]
Given \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, this implies that there might be no valid solution under the given constraints. Let's re-evaluate if an error was made or if we need to check for integer solutions manually.

Question 15/20 (ID: 15):
Q: There are exactly K positive integers b with 5 <= b <= 2024 such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16. What is the sum of the digits of K?

Using exemplars:
1. A number is divisible by 16 if its last two digits are divisible by 16. This means that we need to find all base-b integers from 5 to 2024 (inclusive) such that the last two digits of their decimal representation are divisible by 16.
2. Since there is only one digit position in the range [5, 2024], we only need to check if each number in this range has a last digit that is divisible by 16.
3. We can start by listing all numbers from 5 to 2024 and checking their last digits:
   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (which is divisible by 16), 17, ..., 2024.
4. We can see that every 16th number from the right has a last digit that is divisible by 16. Therefore, we need to count how many numbers in this range satisfy this condition.
5. To do this, we can divide the difference between the largest and smallest numbers (2024 - 5) by 16 and round up to the nearest integer: (2024 - 5) / 16 = 126.4375, which rounds up to 127.
6. Therefore, there are K = 127 positive integers b such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16.
7. Finally, we need to find the sum of the digits of K:
   1 + 2 + 7 = 10.
8. The final answer is $ \boxed{10} $.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many positive integers \( b \) in the range from 5 to 2024 make the base-\( b \) number \( 2024_b \) divisible by 16. We will follow a similar approach as outlined in the given example.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Divisibility Condition:**
   - The number \( 2024_b \) is represented as \( 2b^3 + 0b^2 + 2b + 4 \).
   - For this to be divisible by 16, the expression \( 2b^3 + 2b + 4 \) must be divisible by 16.

2. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - We can factor out a 2 from the terms involving \( b \):
     \[
     2(b^3 + b)
     \]
   - Therefore, for the expression to be divisible by 16:
     \[
     2(b^3 + b) \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
     \]

3. **Check Divisibility Condition:**
   - Since \( 2(b^3 + b) \) is already even, we need \( b^3 + b \) to be divisible by 4.
   - We analyze the parity of \( b \):
     - If \( b \) is odd (e.g., \( b = 1, 3, 5, \ldots \)):
       \[
       b^3 + b \text{ will still include both an odd and even term.}
       \]
     - If \( b \) is even (e.g., \( b = 2, 4, 6, \ldots \)):
       \[
       b^3 \text{ and } b \text{ are both even, thus their sum } b^3 + b \text{ will be divisible by 2.}
       \]
   - We need to check \( b^3 + b \) modulo 4:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \implies b^3 + b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \\
     b &\equiv 1 \pmod{2} \text{ and odd: } b^3 + b &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
     b &\equiv 2 \pmod{4} \implies b^3 + b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
       \end{align*}
     \]

   - Therefore, \( b \) must be even for \( b^3 + b \) to be divisible by 4.

4. **Count Even Numbers in the Range:**
   - We need even numbers between 5 and 2024.
   - The smallest even number is 6 (which is greater than 5).
   - The largest even number within this range is 2024.
   - The sequence of these even numbers forms an arithmetic progression with the first term \( a = 6 \) and common difference \( d = 2 \).

   - We use the formula for the sum of terms in an arithmetic series:
     \[
     n = \frac{\text{Last Term} - \text{First Term}}{d} + 1
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     n = \frac{2024 - 6}{2} + 1 = \frac{2018}{2} + 1 = 1009 + 1 = 1010.
     \]

5. **Sum of Digits of \( K \):**
   - The number of even numbers from 5 to 2024 is \( K = 1010 \).
   - We need to find the sum of the digits of \( K = 1010 \):
     \[
     1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many positive integers \( b \) in the range from 5 to 2024 make the base-\( b \) number \( 2024_b \) divisible by 16. We will follow a similar approach as outlined in the given example.

2. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - We can factor out a 2 from the terms involving \( b \):
     \[
     2(b^3 + b)
     \]
   - Therefore, for the expression to be divisible by 16:
     \[
     2(b^3 + b) \equiv 0 \pmod{8}
     \]

3. **Check Divisibility Condition:**
   - Since \( 2(b^3 + b) \) is already even, we need \( b^3 + b \) to be divisible by 4.
   - We analyze the parity of \( b \):
     - If \( b \) is odd (e.g., \( b = 1, 3, 5, \ldots \)):
       \[
       b^3 + b \text{ will still include both an odd and even term.}
       \]
     - If \( b \) is even (e.g., \( b = 2, 4, 6, \ldots \)):
       \[
       b^3 \text{ and } b \text{ are both even, thus their sum } b^3 + b \text{ will be divisible by 2.}
       \]
   - We need to check \( b^3 + b \) modulo 4:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \implies b^3 + b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \\
     b &\equiv 1 \pmod{2} \text{ and odd: } b^3 + b &\equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \\
     b &\equiv 2 \pmod{4} \implies b^3 + b &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
       \end{align*}
     \]

   - Therefore, \( b \) must be even for \( b^3 + b \) to be divisible by 4.

4. **Count Even Numbers in the Range:**
   - We need even numbers between 5 and 2024.
   - The smallest even number is 6 (which is greater than 5).
   - The largest even number within this range is 2024.
   - The sequence of these even numbers forms an arithmetic progression with the first term \( a = 6 \) and common difference \( d = 2 \).

   - We use the formula for the sum of terms in an arithmetic series:
     \[
     n = \frac{\text{Last Term} - \text{First Term}}{d} + 1
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     n = \frac{2024 - 6}{2} + 1 = \frac{2018}{2} + 1 = 1009 + 1 = 1010.
     \]

5. **Sum of Digits of \( K \):**
   - The number of even numbers from 5 to 2024 is \( K = 1010 \).
   - We need to find the sum of the digits of \( K = 1010 \):
     \[
     1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers a, 720 and b, where a < 720 < b. What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that `a`, `720`, and `b` form a geometric sequence with `a < 720 < b`. We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of `b`.
   
2. **Finding `a`**: Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:
   \[
   \frac{720}{a} = r \quad \text{(common ratio)}
   \]
   Given that `a < 720`, and to maximize `a` (minimize the common ratio), we choose the largest integer factor of `720` less than `720`. The prime factorization of `720` is:
   \[
   720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5
   \]
   Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is `80` (since `90 > 720`). So:
   \[
   a = \frac{720}{9} = 80 \quad \text{(not valid, as 80 < 720)}
   \]
   Correcting the mistake, we should choose \( a = 45 \) instead (as it is the largest integer factor less than 720 that also results in a geometric sequence).

3. **Finding `b`**: Now that we have `a = 45`, then:
   \[
   b = 720 \times r = 720 \times \frac{720}{45}
   \]
   Simplifying further, we find:
   \[
   b = 720 \times \frac{16}{1} = 9600
   \]

4. **Sum of Digits**: The digits in `b` are `9`, `6`, `0`, and `0`. Summing these gives:
   \[
   9 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of the digits of the least possible value of `b` is $\boxed{15}$.

To solve for the least possible value of \(b\) in the geometric sequence where the terms are \(a\), 720, and \(b\), we need to find the common ratio such that \(a < 720 < b\).

Given the sequence is geometric:
- Let the first term be \(a\).
- The second term is 720.
- The third term is \(b\).

The relationship for a geometric sequence can be written as:
\[ \frac{720}{a} = r \]
where \(r\) is the common ratio.

For terms to form a geometric progression, we have:
\[ b = 720r \]

Given that \(a < 720 < b\), the value of \(r\) must be such that \(b > 720\). To find the least possible value of \(b\), we need to maximize \(r\).

We start by finding the largest factor of 720:
\[ 720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 \]
The factors of 720 are: 
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 48, 60, 72, 80, 90, 120, 144, 180, 240, 270, 360, 720 \]

The largest factor less than 720 is 60. Thus:
\[ r = \frac{720}{a} = \frac{720}{60} = 12 \]
Since \(a < 720\), the next smallest valid \(a\) greater than 1 would be 45 (as \(r > 1\)).

Thus:
\[ r = \frac{720}{45} = 16 \]

Using this value of \(r\):
\[ b = 720 \times 16 = 11520 \]

Next, we find the sum of the digits of 11520:
\[ 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 = 9 \]

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the least possible value of \(b\) is:
\[
\boxed{9}

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: Let S be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 2024} such that for distinct elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 2, and for distinct odd elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 6. What is the maximum possible number of elements in S?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The set \( S \) is a subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \).
   - For distinct elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 2 \).
   - For distinct odd elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 6 \).

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers:**
   - The odd numbers in the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \) are:
     \[
     1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023
     \]
   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and last term \( l = 2023 \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers:**
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a + (n-1)d
     \]
     Setting \( a_n = 2023 \):
     \[
     2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n-1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 1012 odd numbers in the set.

4. **Applying the Odd Number Constraint:**
   - Since the difference between any two distinct odd elements must be greater than 6, we can select every 7th odd number to maximize the count:
     \[
     1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1012}{7} = 144 \) terms.

5. **Applying the Even Number Constraint:**
   - For even numbers, the difference must be greater than 2. We can select every 3rd even number:
     \[
     2, 5, 8, \ldots, 2022
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1011}{3} = 337 \) terms.

6. **Combining the Counts:**
   - The total number of elements in \( S \) is the sum of the odd and even counts:
     \[
     144 + 337 = 481
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum possible number of elements in \( S \) is \( \boxed{481} \).

     k = 506

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Integers a, b, and c satisfy ab + c = 10, bc + a = 87, and ca + b = 60. What is ab + bc + ca?

Using exemplars:
1. We are given three equations involving integers a, b, and c:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Adding these three equations together gives us the sum of all products of two different numbers from a, b, and c, plus an extra copy of each number:
   - (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
   - ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

3. We want to find the value of ab + bc + ca, but we have an extra term with c + a + b. However, since we know that (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 157, and each number appears exactly once in each equation, then:
   - c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

4. Now, let's subtract the extra term from our previous sum:
   - (ab + bc + ca + c + a + b) - (c + a + b) = 157 - (c + a + b)
   - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 157

5. To find the value of ab + bc + ca, we can divide both sides by 2:
   - ab + bc + ca = 157 / 2
   - $$ \boxed{78.5} $$

Let's solve the given problem step-by-step.

We are given:
\[ ab + c = 10 \]
\[ bc + a = 87 \]
\[ ca + b = 60 \]

Our goal is to find \( ab + bc + ca \).

First, add all three equations together:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157
\]

Since \( ab + c = 10 \), we can substitute this into the equation above. First, isolate \( ab \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
ab = 10 - c
\]

Next, let's rewrite our combined sum using \( ab \):

\[
(10 - c) + bc + ca + b = 157
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
10 + bc + ca + (b - c) = 157
\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

\[
bc + ca + b - c = 147
\]

Factor the left-hand side:

\[
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147
\]

Now, let's use another method to find \( ab + bc + ca \). We can subtract each of the original equations from the sum we derived earlier. For example, subtracting the first equation from our combined sum gives:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (ab + c) = 157 - 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(bc + ca + b + a) = 147
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147
\]

We already know this from the first method. Next, subtract the second equation:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (bc + a) = 157 - 87
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + ca + (b + a) = 70
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(a - c)(b - 1) = 70
\]

Similarly, subtract the third equation:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (ca + b) = 157 - 60
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + bc + (a + b) = 97
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

From these three factorizations, we have:
\[ 
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147 \\
(a - c)(b - 1) = 70 \\
(b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

Notice that \( (b + c)(a - 1) \), \( (a - c)(b - 1) \), and \( (b - c)(a - 1) \) all involve the same term \((a-1)\). Therefore, we can equate these products by considering the relationships between them. Assume:
\[ 
(b + c)(a - 1) = k \\
(a - c)(b - 1) = m \\
(b - c)(a - 1) = n
\]

Given \( k \cdot m \cdot n = 147 \cdot 70 \cdot 97 \), we find the common terms:
\[ 
k = (b + c)(a - 1) = 147 \\
m = (a - c)(b - 1) = 70 \\
n = (b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

Since \( k \cdot m \cdot n \) is the product of these terms, we can solve for the sum:

\[ 
ab + bc + ca = 147 + 70 + 97 = 314
\]

Thus, the value of \( ab + bc + ca \) is:

\[
\boxed{314}
\]
Answer: Let's solve the given problem step-by-step.

We are given:
\[ ab + c = 10 \]
\[ bc + a = 87 \]
\[ ca + b = 60 \]

Our goal is to find \( ab + bc + ca \).

(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157
\]

Since \( ab + c = 10 \), we can substitute this into the equation above. First, isolate \( ab \) in terms of \( c \):

\[
ab = 10 - c
\]

Next, let's rewrite our combined sum using \( ab \):

\[
(10 - c) + bc + ca + b = 157
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
10 + bc + ca + (b - c) = 157
\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

\[
bc + ca + b - c = 147
\]

Factor the left-hand side:

\[
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147
\]

Now, let's use another method to find \( ab + bc + ca \). We can subtract each of the original equations from the sum we derived earlier. For example, subtracting the first equation from our combined sum gives:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (ab + c) = 157 - 10
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(bc + ca + b + a) = 147
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147

We already know this from the first method. Next, subtract the second equation:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (bc + a) = 157 - 87
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + ca + (b + a) = 70
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(a - c)(b - 1) = 70
\]

Similarly, subtract the third equation:

\[
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) - (ca + b) = 157 - 60
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
ab + bc + (a + b) = 97
\]

Rewriting using \( ab \):

\[
(b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

From these three factorizations, we have:
\[ 
(b + c)(a - 1) = 147 \\
(a - c)(b - 1) = 70 \\
(b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

Notice that \( (b + c)(a - 1) \), \( (a - c)(b - 1) \), and \( (b - c)(a - 1) \) all involve the same term \((a-1)\). Therefore, we can equate these products by considering the relationships between them. Assume:
\[ 
(b + c)(a - 1) = k \\
(a - c)(b - 1) = m \\
(b - c)(a - 1) = n
\]

Given \( k \cdot m \cdot n = 147 \cdot 70 \cdot 97 \), we find the common terms:
\[ 
k = (b + c)(a - 1) = 147 \\
m = (a - c)(b - 1) = 70 \\
n = (b - c)(a - 1) = 97
\]

Since \( k \cdot m \cdot n \) is the product of these terms, we can solve for the sum:

\[ 
ab + bc + ca = 147 + 70 + 97 = 314
\]

Thus, the value of \( ab + bc + ca \) is:

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: A bee moves in 3D space based on die rolls (A+/A- for x, B+/B- for y, C+/C- for z). Starting at origin with 4 rolls, what's the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand that a die roll can result in any number from 1 to 6 (since it's not specified otherwise). However, in the context of this problem, each roll represents a step along the x, y, or z axis of a unit cube. So, we are only interested in whether a roll results in a positive (+) or negative (-) step.
2. For the bee to traverse 4 distinct edges of a unit cube starting from the origin and moving in 3D space based on die rolls, it means that each axis (x, y, z) should have at least one positive and one negative step. The order of these steps doesn't matter.
3. Now, let's calculate the probability of this happening:
   a. Probability of rolling a positive or negative step on any axis is 1/2 (since there are two outcomes - + and -).
   b. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each axis to get the overall probability.
4. Therefore, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges is:
$$ \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} $$

Model response:
qwen2.5:3b progress:  95%|██████████████████████████████▍ | 19/20 [06:22<00:20, 20.04s/it]
To solve this problem, let's follow a structured approach similar to the example provided:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The bee needs to traverse 4 distinct edges in a 3D space.
   - Each roll can result in either an A+ (positive step along the x-axis) or an A- (negative step along the x-axis).
   - Similarly, each roll for B and C axes will also be either B+ or B-, C+ or C- respectively.

2. **Distinct Edges Requirement**:
   - For a unit cube traversed from origin to another distinct point with 4 rolls, it means that we must traverse all three coordinate axes at least once (x, y, z).
   - This implies we need exactly two positive and two negative steps in x, y, and z directions. 

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability of rolling a + or - step on any one axis is \( \frac{1}{2} \) since there are only two possible outcomes per roll.
   - We need to ensure that all three axes (x, y, z) have at least one positive and one negative step.

4. **Ensuring All Axes**:
   - To achieve this, we must exclude the scenarios where all rolls on any axis result in either + or - steps only. This means not rolling A+ for x or B+ for y or C+ for z four times continuously.
   
5. **Counting Valid Sequences**:
   - We need to count sequences of 4 rolls where each coordinate has at least one positive and negative step.

6. **Total Possible Outcomes**:
   - Total possible outcomes are \(2^4 = 16\).

7. **Excluding Invalid Sequences**:
   - The invalid sequences include all sequences with only + or - for any axis over four rolls.
   - For each coordinate, there are exactly 2 such sequences (all + or all -). 
   - However, we need to subtract the overlap where two coordinates could be completely negative and one positive. But since x, y, z must all have at least one of each sign:
     - The invalid combinations can be calculated as \(3 \times 1 = 3\) (choosing which coordinate will be the only positive).
   - Thus, there are \(2^4 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\) valid sequences for a single axis.

8. **Combining Axes**:
   - Since each axis is independent and we need all three axes to satisfy our condition (each must have at least one positive and one negative roll), the number of valid sequences across x, y, z is \( \frac{16}{3} \approx 5\) but since these are specific rolls that do not overlap directly, we can simply count as:
     - We need all such combinations where each axis has exactly two positive steps over four rolls. This means there are 6 valid sequences (combinations of which step is positive).

9. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8} \).

So, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}

Answer: To solve this problem, let's follow a structured approach similar to the example provided:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The bee needs to traverse 4 distinct edges in a 3D space.
   - Each roll can result in either an A+ (positive step along the x-axis) or an A- (negative step along the x-axis).
   - Similarly, each roll for B and C axes will also be either B+ or B-, C+ or C- respectively.

2. **Distinct Edges Requirement**:
   - For a unit cube traversed from origin to another distinct point with 4 rolls, it means that we must traverse all three coordinate axes at least once (x, y, z).
   - This implies we need exactly two positive and two negative steps in x, y, and z directions. 

3. **Probability Calculation**:

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: In a line of people, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. How many people are in the line?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the total number of people in the line as N.
2. According to the problem, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. This means that there are 1012 people between this person and the end of the line (since the last person isn't counted twice).
3. Therefore, we can write the equation: N = 1013 + 1012.
4. Solving for N gives us N = 2025.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{2025} $$

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( N \) be the total number of people in the line.
2. The 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right.

To understand their positions relative to each other:
- Being the 1013th person from the left means they are at position \( 1012 \) (since this position counts as the starting point, not the end).
- Being the 1010th person from the right implies that there are 999 people to their right.

The gap between these two positions is \( 1013 - 1010 = 3 \).

Now, we must consider that in a line:
- The first person (leftmost) is at position \( 1 \).
- The last person is at position \( N \).

Since there are 3 people between the positions of \( 1012 \) and some position \( P \), these three people create an additional gap of 3. This means:
\[ N - 1 = 1010 + 3 \]

Simplifying this equation gives:
\[ N - 1 = 1013 \]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[ N = 1014 \]

Thus, the total number of people in the line is \( 1014 \).

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{1014} $$

  "To solve this problem, let's follow a structured approach similar to the example provided:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The bee needs to traverse 4 distinct edges in a 3D space.\n   - Each roll can result in either an A+ (positive step along the x-axis) or an A- (negative step along the x-axis).\n   - Similarly, each roll for B and C axes will also be either B+ or B-, C+ or C- respectively.\n\n2. **Distinct Edges Requirement**:\n   - For a unit cube traversed from origin to another distinct point with 4 rolls, it means that we must traverse all three coordinate axes at least once (x, y, z).\n   - This implies we need exactly two positive and two negative steps in x, y, and z directions. \n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability of rolling a + or - step on any one axis is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) since there are only two possible outcomes per roll.\n   - We need to ensure that all three axes (x, y, z) have at least one positive and one negative step.\n\n4. **Ensuring All Axes**:\n   - To achieve this, we must exclude the scenarios where all rolls on any axis result in either + or - steps only. This means not rolling A+ for x or B+ for y or C+ for z four times continuously.\n   \n5. **Counting Valid Sequences**:\n   - We need to count sequences of 4 rolls where each coordinate has at least one positive and negative step.\n\n6. **Total Possible Outcomes**:\n   - Total possible outcomes are \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n7. **Excluding Invalid Sequences**:\n   - The invalid sequences include all sequences with only + or - for any axis over four rolls.\n   - For each coordinate, there are exactly 2 such sequences (all + or all -). \n   - However, we need to subtract the overlap where two coordinates could be completely negative and one positive. But since x, y, z must all have at least one of each sign:\n     - The invalid combinations can be calculated as \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) (choosing which coordinate will be the only positive).\n   - Thus, there are \\(2^4 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\\) valid sequences for a single axis.\n\n8. **Combining Axes**:\n   - Since each axis is independent and we need all three axes to satisfy our condition (each must have at least one positive and one negative roll), the number of valid sequences across x, y, z is \\( \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5\\) but since these are specific rolls that do not overlap directly, we can simply count as:\n     - We need all such combinations where each axis has exactly two positive steps over four rolls.
