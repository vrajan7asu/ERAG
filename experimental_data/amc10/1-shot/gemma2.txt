Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the value of 9901*101 - 99*10101?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factor out the common term, which is 101:
   9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = 101 * (9901 - 99)

2. Now, calculate the difference inside the parentheses:
   9901 - 99 = 9802

3. Then, multiply this result by 101:
   101 * 9802 = $$1009902$$

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1.  Factor out the common term:**

   We can factor out a 101 from both terms in the expression:
   9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = 101 * (9901 - 99) * 101 


**2. Calculate the difference:**

    *  9901 - 99 = 9802


**3.  Multiply and simplify:**

   101 * 9802 = $$980202$$




Therefore, the value of 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 is **$980202**.

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form T = aL + bG, where a and b are constants, T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, as well as if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b. We can do this by setting up two equations using the given information:

For the first hike: T = aL + bG => 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   For the second hike: T = aL + bG => T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

T2 - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800) => T2 - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300)

3. Let's denote T2 as X (it's just for simplicity). So, we have:

X - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300) ...(Equation 1)
   And from the first equation we have:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) ...(Equation 2)

4. Now, we can solve these two equations for a and b. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.5 and Equation 2 by -0.3:

1.5X - 69*1.5 = a(-0.3 * 1.5) + b(300 * 1.5) => 1.5X - 103.5 = a(-0.45) + b(450) ...(Equation 3)
   And from Equation 2 we have:
   -0.3*69 = a(1.5 * -0.3) + b(800 * -0.3) => -20.7 = a(-0.45) + b(-240) ...(Equation 4)

5. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   1.5X - 103.5 - 20.7 = 0 => 1.5X = 124.2 => X = $89.467$ (approximately)

6. Now that we have the value of T2, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a and b. Let's use Equation 2:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) => 69 - 1.5a = 800b => a/b = (800b)/(69-1.5a)
   But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that T2 is actually approximately 90 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   90 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 90 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(90-1.2a)
   Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (90-1.2a)
   Solving this equation gives us:
   a = $0.056$, b = $0.078$

7. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   T = aL + bG => T = 0.056*4.2 + 0.078*4000 => T = $312$ minutes (approximately)

So, the model estimates that it will take approximately \boxed{312} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

Here's how to solve the problem using the provided model and the given information:

**1. Set up Equations:**

* We know T = aL + bG gives us two equations based on the hikes with different trail lengths and altitude gains. 
   *  For Hike 1 (1.5 miles, 800ft): T₁ = a(1.5) + b(800) = 69 minutes
   * For Hike 2 (1.2 miles, 1100ft): T₂ = a(1.2) + b(1100) =  [We need to find this value]

**2. Solve for Constants (a and b):**

* **Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:**
   T₂ - T₁ = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800)  
   [We need to find the value of T₂ and substitute it into this equation]

* **Simplify using the given information:** 
    The model estimates that it takes T₂ = 69 minutes (using 1.5 miles and 800 feet). You'll have to use values from above to calculate this.


**3. Calculate Time for a trail of 4.2 miles & 4000ft:**

* We now know the value of T₂. Substitute into the original model equation (T = aL + bG) with L= 4.2 miles and G = 4000 feet, to get the final estimated time.

   *  Be sure to use the values you've calculated for T₁ , T₂, and constants 'a' and 'b'.

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand what a "prime" number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Next, let's find the smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
3. If we add up these first five primes (2+3+5+7+11), we get 28. However, 28 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (it can be divided by 4).
4. So, we need to find another combination of five distinct primes that sum up to a prime number. The next possible combination is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. But again, 49 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 7.
5. Continuing this process, we eventually find the combination (2+3+5+11+17), which sums up to 38. This is still not a prime number.
6. Finally, we reach the combination (2+3+5+11+19), which sums up to 40. This is also not a prime number.
7. Moving on, we try (2+3+5+17+19), which sums up to 46. Again, this is not a prime number.
8. The next combination we try is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. This is also not a prime number.
9. We continue this process until we find the combination (2+3+5+11+23), which sums up to 44. Again, this is not a prime number.
10. Finally, we reach the combination (3+5+7+13+17), which sums up to 45. This is also not a prime number.
11. We continue this process until we find that no other combination of five distinct primes will sum up to a prime number. Therefore, the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes does not exist.

Let's break down why there's no simple solution to find the specific smallest prime number expressible as a sum of five distinct primes.  

**The Challenge:**

* **Prime Numbers are Unpredictable:** Finding a prime number is about searching for an integer greater than 1 that's only divisible by 1 and itself (except for special cases like 0). There's no general method to predict which numbers will be prime or, more precisely, whether any particular combination of primes will sum up to another prime.
* **Complex Arithmetic:** The process of finding combinations of distinct primes that result in prime sums is inherently complex.  It involves a high degree of computational complexity and testing different combinations.

**Why we can't simply calculate the answer:** There isn't a clear formula or rule to determine which sum of prime numbers equals the smallest prime number. 


**How to Approach This Problem:**
1. **Understanding Prime Number Theory:**  A deeper understanding of prime numbers (and their behavior) would be helpful, but it's not always practical in finding the smallest number with a specific sum.

2. **Trial and Error:** Given the complexity, you could try different combinations of primes to see if they lead to a prime sum. The process is highly time-consuming.  


**Final Thoughts** 
Determining the smallest prime that can be expressed as a sum of five distinct primes is complex, even with advanced mathematical approaches and computer algorithms.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need more clarification on the concept of prime numbers!

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: The number 2024 is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by identifying that we need to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers, where these numbers may repeat.
2. The maximum value for each two-digit number is 99, so the minimum number of such numbers needed can be found by dividing 2024 by 99 and rounding up since we are dealing with integers: 
   \[
   \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44 \Rightarrow 21
   \]
3. To confirm if 21 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024, consider using the highest possible value for each, which is 99:
   \[
   21 \times 99 = 2079
   \]
   This exceeds 2024. Therefore, we need more than 21 numbers, but let's check if 22 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.
4. If each number was 99, the sum would be:
   \[
   22 \times 99 = 2178
   \]
   We now reduce values of some numbers below 99 to achieve the exact sum of 2024. For example, setting two numbers to 52 instead of 99 gives us:
   \[
   20 \times 99 + 2 \times 52 = 1980 + 104 = 2084
   \]
   This is still too high. Instead, using the strategy of replacing two numbers with lower values might work better. Let's consider reducing two pairs:
   
   - Replace the first pair (99, 99) with (52, 52):
     \[
     1980 + 4 = 1984 \quad (\text{closer but still high})
     \]
   - Now replace another pair with (52, 52), we get:
     \[
     1984 + 4 = 2024 \quad (\text{exact sum achieved})
     \]
   
   The above strategy works, and indeed, 20 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Finding the Maximum Value:**

* The maximum value for a two-digit number is 99.

Q: What is the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factorize 2024 into its prime factors. 2024 = 2^3 * 7 * 11
2. For n! to be a multiple of 2024, it must contain at least three factors of 2 (because 2024 has three factors of 2), one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.
3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is when n = 11, because 11! will contain all the necessary factors: three factors of 2 (from 2, 4, and 8), one factor of 7 (from 7), and one factor of 11 (from 11).

Here's how to determine the least value of *n* for which *n!* is a multiple of 2024:

**1. Factorize 2024:**

   *  2024 = 2<sup>3</sup> × 7 × 11 

**2. Understand the Requirements:**

   * For *n!* to be a multiple of 2024, it must include at least:
      * Three factors of 2 (since 2024 has three '2's).
      * One factor of 7.
      * One factor of 11.

**3. Find the Smallest *n***

   * We need to find the smallest value of *n* that satisfies these requirements:
       *  Three factors of 2 (from 2, 4, and 8)
       *  One factor of 7
       *  One factor of 11

**4. Determine 'n':**

   * The prime factorization of 2024 helps us determine the smallest *n*.  
   *  We want a value of *n* such that when we calculate n!, the result includes each of the required prime factors (2, 7, and 11). 
   * The combination of 7 and 11 is not possible with any single number. We need to use the powers of 2 in the factorial.  

**5. Calculate 'n':**

  * The value of n = 11 satisfies all the conditions we've defined, as 11! contains three factors of 2, one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: What is the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We need to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using swaps of adjacent letters. The goal is to find the minimum number of such swaps.
2. To solve this, we can visualize the problem as a graph where each letter is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are adjacent in the string and can be swapped.
3. We can start by looking at the first and last letters (A and F). Since they are not adjacent, we need to swap them with other letters. The closest non-adjacent letter to A is D, so we swap A and D, making the string BCDFA.
4. Now, let's look at the new first and last letters (B and F). They are still not adjacent, but we can swap F and C to get BCADF.
5. Finally, we can swap A and D again to get the desired string FEDCBA.
6. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required is 3.

Here's how to solve the problem, breaking down the steps:

**1. Visualizing the Problem:**

* Imagine each letter as a node in a graph where edges represent adjacent letters (e.g., A-B, B-C).  
* We want to find the minimum number of swaps needed to form FEDCBA, effectively "moving" nodes around. 

**2. Identifying Potential Swaps:**

* **Start with A and F:** These are not adjacent in the initial string. Swap them (changing the order from ABCDEFA to BCDFA).
    
**3. Analyzing Subsequent Moves:**

* We have now moved B and F, but not D or C. 
* To get FEDCBA, we need to swap letters as they become possible based on previous swaps (think about the graph structure we're working with).  


**4. Finding the Minimum Swaps:**


There is no easy answer here without going through each swap and seeing how many steps it requires. It is difficult to determine the minimum number of steps in this case.

Q: The product of three integers is 60. What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

Using exemplars:

2. To minimize the sum of these integers, we should choose the smallest possible factors that multiply to give 60. The smallest possible set of three factors is 1, 2, and 30 because their product is 60 (1 * 2 * 30 = 60) and their sum is the smallest among all possible combinations of factors.

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria work in a chocolate factory. On Monday Amy, Bomani, and Charlie started working at 1:00 PM and were able to pack 4, 3, and 3 packages, respectively, every 3 minutes. At some later time, Daria joined the group, and Daria was able to pack 5 packages every 4 minutes. Together, they finished packing 450 packages at exactly 2:45 PM. At what time did Daria join the group?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them. They worked for 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM).

Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, she would have packed $4 \times (45/3) = 60$ packages.
Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.
Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.

2. Together, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed $60 + 45 + 45 = 150$ packages before Daria joined them.

3. Now let's find out when Daria started working. We know that after she joined, they finished packing the remaining 450 - 150 = 300 packages.

4. Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so to pack 300 packages, it would take her $300 / 5 = 60$ minutes. Since they finished packing at 2:45 PM, Daria must have joined them 1 hour before this time, which is at 1:45 PM.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{1:45} $$ was the time when Daria joined the group.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate individual packing speeds:**

* Amy: Packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so she packs 4/(3 minutes) = 1.33 packages per minute. 
* Bomani: Packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so he packs 3/(3 minutes) = 1 package per minute. 
* Charlie: Packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so he packs 3/(3 minutes) = 1 package per minute. 
* Daria: Packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so she packs 5/(4 minutes) = 1.25 packages per minute.

**2. Calculate the total number of packages packed before Daria joined:**

* Amy + Bomani + Charlie = 1.33 + 1 + 1 = 3.33 packages per minute
* Since they worked for a total of 45 minutes, they would have packed 3.33 * 45 = 149.95 packages before Daria joined (approximately).

**3. Calculate the number of packages left to pack:**

* Total packages to be packed - already packed = packages remaining
* 450 - 149.95 = 270.05 packages remaining

**4. Determine when Daria joined:**

*  We know that they finished packing 450 at exactly 2:45 PM. We also need to find the time when the number of packages needed to be packed is equal to 270.05 (meaning 270.05 packages were left after being worked upon).
* Since their pace needs to be calculated every minute, let's calculate how many minutes Daria would have to work before packing 270.05 packages. 

**5. Calculate the time when Daria joined:**

*  Daria needed to pack for 270.05 / 1.25 = 216 minutes (approximately)
*  Since they finished packing at 2:45 PM, if Daria joined at 1:45 PM, it will take her 270.05/1.25 = 216 minutes to finish the job, which is equal to 216/60 = 3.6 hours or 3.6 * 60 = 216 minutes.
*  Daria must have joined the group at 1:45 PM (2:45 PM + 3.6 hours). 

**Therefore, $$ answer $$:** Daria joined the group at **1:45 PM**.

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: In how many ways can 6 juniors and 6 seniors form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to select 2 juniors out of 6 for the first team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
2. After selecting 2 juniors for the first team, we have 4 juniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 6 for the second team. The number of ways to do this is also given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
3. Now, we have 4 juniors and 4 seniors left. We need to select 2 juniors out of 4 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 4 is C(4, 2).
4. Similarly, we have 2 seniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 2 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 2 is C(2, 2).
5. Finally, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)} $$

Here's how to solve the problem, following the same logic as provided in the example solutions:

**1. Selecting Juniors for Team 1:**

* We need to choose 2 juniors out of 6 for the first team:  C(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(4!) = 15 ways

**2. Selecting Seniors for Team 1:**

* After selecting the juniors, we'll have 4 seniors left. We need to choose 2 seniors out of these remaining ones: C(4, 2) = 4! / [2!(2!) = 6 ways.


**3. Forming Teams with Remaining Juniors and Seniors:**
* We have two teams now that can either have the same combination of juniors and seniors for each team as we did in step 1.


This gives us a total of **C(6, 2) * C(4, 2)** = 15 * 6 = 90 ways to form the teams.

**Final Answer:** $$ 90 $$

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Consider the following operation. Given a positive integer n, if n is a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n/3. If n is not a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n+10. Then continue this process. Suppose you start with n=100. What value results if you perform this operation exactly 100 times?

Using exemplars:
1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.
2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110 + 10 = 120.
3. Continue this process:
   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 120 + 10 = 130.
   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130 + 10 = 140.
   - n = 140 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140 + 10 = 150.
   - n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.
4. Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.
5. Continue this process:
   - n = 60 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
6. Now n = 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.
7. Continue this process:
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
8. We can see that the operation will keep oscillating between 10 and 30, but since the question asks for the result after exactly 100 operations, we need to continue this process for 100 times. However, it's clear that the operation will always result in either 10 or 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division).
9. Since the operation is performed an even number of times (100), the final result will be determined by whether we end up with n = 10 or n = 30 after the first 98 operations. This depends on the remainder when dividing 98 by 2 (since the pattern repeats every two operations).
10. The remainder when dividing 98 by 2 is 0, which means we will end up with n = 30 after the first 98 operations. Then, in the last two operations, we perform one addition and one division:
    - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
    - n = 10 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.

The final answer is \boxed{20}.

Let's break down the steps and find the solution:

**Understanding the Operation:**

The rules of our operation are as follows:

* **Multiple of 3:** If *n* is a multiple of 3 (divisible by 3), replace it with *n/3*.
* **Not a Multiple of 3:** If *n* is not a multiple of 3, replace it with *n + 10*.

**Applying the Rules:**

We'll use this pattern to track the value of 'n' as we go through our operations. We need to apply the rules precisely 100 times. Here's how:

1. **Start (n = 100):**  
   * n is not a multiple of 3, so it goes to *n + 10 = 110*.
2. **Continue:**  
   * We continue applying these rules until we reach the final step.

 **The Process:** 
As we apply these steps, you'll see that our operation will repeatedly oscillate between 10 and 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division). 
**Important Insight**

Since the operation repeats every two steps,  we can use this to solve. The last step (after 100 operations) depends on whether we end up with 10 or 30 in the previous steps.


**Calculation**

We must find the value of *n* after 100 operations. We need to determine if *n* reaches a multiple of 3 or remains odd as it goes through the 100 operation cycles.

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: How many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m?

Using exemplars:
1. We start with the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. Since m is an integer, it means that n^2 - 49 must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as k^2. So, we have n^2 - 49 = k^2.

3. Rearranging the equation gives us n^2 = k^2 + 49, or (n-k)(n+k) = 49.

4. The factors of 49 are ±1, ±7, and ±49. So, we have six possible pairs for (n-k, n+k): (1, 49), (-1, -49), (7, 42), (-7, -42), (49, 1), and (-49, -1).

5. For each pair of (n-k, n+k), we can solve for n and m:
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (1, 49), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-1, -49), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (7, 42), then n = 24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-7, -42), then n = -24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (49, 1), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-49, -1), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.

6. So, there are four ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation: (25, 25), (25, -25), (-25, 25), and (-25, -25).

\boxed{4}

Here's the solution process for finding the number of ordered pairs satisfying the equation:

**1. Rewriting the Equation:**

   Similar to the previous example, start with the original equation: 
   √(n² - 49) = m

**2. Understanding the Problem:**

  The goal is to find all possible integer values for (m, n) that satisfy this equation, meaning the square root of  'n²-49' equals 'm'.  This suggests we might be looking for pairs where one number 'n' relates to another 'm' in such a way that the square root of 'n² - 49' is equal to 'm'.

**3. Analyzing the Equation:**

   * **Perfect Squares:** To simplify, focus on finding perfect squares that fit within 'n² - 49'.  
   * **Solving for n:** We can rearrange the equation to isolate 'n':
      √(n² - 49) = m → (n² - 49) = m²

   This is a bit different from the previous example. The key here is that we're dealing with squares of values related to our 'n'.


**4.  Determining Possible Solutions:**
    * **Perfect Square Formula:** We need to determine if there are perfect square solutions for 'n'. We can use this formula to check: (n + k)(n - k) = 49

   * **Finding Possible Values for n and m:** For each pair of values for 'n', calculate the corresponding value of 'm' using the equation.  


**5. Analyzing and Identifying Solutions:**
    * **Check the pairs:** Examine if any of the calculated pairs satisfy the original equation, i.e., check if √(n² - 49) = m is a true statement for all values of (m, n).



**Important Notes:**

* The goal is to find all ordered pairs (m, n) that meet the condition √(n² - 49) = m

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations from this list (translation 2 units right, 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin, reflection across x-axis, dilation at origin with scale factor 2), how many commute?

Using exemplars:
1. A transformation commutes if it doesn't matter in which order you apply the transformations. This means that applying transformation T followed by transformation R should yield the same result as applying transformation R followed by transformation T.
2. Translation 2 units right is a linear transformation, and it does not affect the other transformations (since translation is an isometry). Therefore, it can commute with all transformations.
3. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This transformation commutes with reflection across x-axis because a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection across the y-axis, and vice versa. However, it does not commute with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling.
4. Reflection across x-axis: This transformation commutes with 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin (as mentioned in step 3). It also commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because reflecting followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by reflecting.
5. Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This transformation does not commute with any other transformations on this list, as scaling affects the outcome of the other transformations (translation and rotation).
6. Based on our analysis, only three pairs of distinct transformations commute (translation with reflection, translation with dilation, and reflection with 90-degree rotation). The final answer is $ \boxed{3} $.

Here's the breakdown of which transformations commute and why:

**Understanding Commutation:**

Commutativity means applying one transformation followed by another will give you the same result as applying the second transformation followed by the first. 

**Analyzing the Pairs:**

1. **Translation 2 units right  and Reflection across x-axis:**  Both are linear transformations that do not change the shape (translation) and reflect it around the origin. Thus, they commute.
2. **Translation 2 units right and Dilation at origin with scale factor 2:** These two transformations create geometric effects like expansion and displacement. As they act on different points in space, their commutative property does not hold true.
3. **90-degree rotation counterclockwise about the origin and Reflection across x-axis:** Both these transformations are about rotations and reflections of shapes, which commute with each other. 
4. **Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 and 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about the origin:** The dilation transformation is scaling a shape in terms of its dimensions; it can affect the shape's overall look. Because the rotation changes its orientation and direction, their commutative property does not hold true.
5. **Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 and Reflection across x-axis:** Dilation affects the distance between objects in space, while reflection creates a mirror image of an object on a plane. The effects of these two transformations are independent, meaning they don't commute.

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: Let M be the greatest integer such that both M + 1213 and M + 3773 are perfect squares. What is the unit digit of M?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies. Since both M+1213 and M+3773 are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.

2. The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference: sqrt(2560/2) = 41 (since 41*41 = 1681 and 42*42 = 1764, which are both greater than our range).

3. Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over: (sqrt(1213)-41)^2 < M < (sqrt(3773)-41)^2 => 904 < M < 2560.

4. Since we're looking for the unit digit of M, we can narrow down our search to numbers between 904 and 2560 with specific unit digits. The possible units digits for perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

5. Testing these values, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.

6. The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: For a two-out-of-three playoff with Team A having 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away, if Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, and p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)) where m,n are positive integers, what is m + n?

Using exemplars:
1. Team A has a 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away. Since it's a two-out-of-three playoff, we need to consider the scenarios where Team A wins exactly two games out of three.

2. There are two possible ways for Team A to win two games:
   a) Win both games at home (2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 chance).
   b) Win one game at home and one game away ((2/3)*p + (1-2/3)*(1-p)).

3. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, so we can set up an equation: 4/9 + (2/3)*p + (1/3)*(1-p) = 1/2.

4. Solving this equation for p gives us: p = 1/6 * (m - sqrt(n)).

5. Since m and n are positive integers, we can find possible values by trial and error. One such solution is m=5 and n=4.

   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (which is divisible by 16), 17, ..., 2024.
4. We can see that every 16th number from the right has a last digit that is divisible by 16. Therefore, we need to count how many numbers in this range satisfy this condition.
5. To do this, we can divide the difference between the largest and smallest numbers (2024 - 5) by 16 and round up to the nearest integer: (2024 - 5) / 16 = 126.4375, which rounds up to 127.
6. Therefore, there are K = 127 positive integers b such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16.
7. Finally, we need to find the sum of the digits of K:
   1 + 2 + 7 = 10.
8. The final answer is $ \boxed{10} $.

Here's how to solve the problem, following the same logic as the example solutions:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the number of bases (b) within a specific range that make 2024 * b divisible by 16.  

**Solution Approach:**

* **Focus on divisibility:** The key is figuring out which numbers, when expressed in base 'b', result in a remainder of 0 after dividing by 16.

* **Consider the base:**  Since we know that our number (2024 * b) must be divisible by 16, let's look at what powers of 16 fit into this range:
    * 16^1 = 16 
    * 16^2 = 256
    * ... and so on.

**Finding the Value of K:**  To find a base that fits our requirement, we need to look at the multiples of 16 within our range (5 ≤ b ≤ 2024). We'll use this approach:

1. **Calculate:** We need to count how many numbers from 5 to 2024 satisfy the divisibility by 16 condition, and then find the sum of the digits in K as determined by these numbers.  


**Example Solution (Working through):**
   *  First, we know that our base must be a whole number. We're looking for the power of 16 within a given range (5 to 2024).  

   *  We can use trial and error to find the divisibility by 16 condition, as this is a more straightforward approach than using complex algorithms such as modular arithmetic.


**Final Answer:**

I need you to provide me with the specific values of b that satisfy the divisibility conditions, so I can calculate the sum of the digits in K.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers a, 720 and b, where a < 720 < b. What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that `a`, `720`, and `b` form a geometric sequence with `a < 720 < b`. We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of `b`.
   
2. **Finding `a`**: Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:
   \[
   \frac{720}{a} = r \quad \text{(common ratio)}
   \]
   Given that `a < 720`, and to maximize `a` (minimize the common ratio), we choose the largest integer factor of `720` less than `720`. The prime factorization of `720` is:
   \[
   720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5
   \]
   Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is `80` (since `90 > 720`). So:
   \[
   a = \frac{720}{9} = 80 \quad \text{(not valid, as 80 < 720)}
   \]
   Correcting the mistake, we should choose \( a = 45 \) instead (as it is the largest integer factor less than 720 that also results in a geometric sequence).

3. **Finding `b`**: Now that we have `a = 45`, then:
   \[
   b = 720 \times r = 720 \times \frac{720}{45}
   \]
   Simplifying further, we find:
   \[
   b = 720 \times \frac{16}{1} = 9600
   \]

4. **Sum of Digits**: The digits in `b` are `9`, `6`, `0`, and `0`. Summing these gives:
   \[
   9 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of the digits of the least possible value of `b` is $\boxed{15}$.

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: Let S be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 2024} such that for distinct elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 2, and for distinct odd elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 6. What is the maximum possible number of elements in S?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The set \( S \) is a subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \).
   - For distinct elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 2 \).
   - For distinct odd elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 6 \).

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers:**
   - The odd numbers in the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \) are:
     \[
     1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023
     \]
   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and last term \( l = 2023 \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers:**
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a + (n-1)d
     \]
     Setting \( a_n = 2023 \):
     \[
     2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n-1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 1012 odd numbers in the set.

4. **Applying the Odd Number Constraint:**
   - Since the difference between any two distinct odd elements must be greater than 6, we can select every 7th odd number to maximize the count:
     \[
     1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1012}{7} = 144 \) terms.

5. **Applying the Even Number Constraint:**
   - For even numbers, the difference must be greater than 2. We can select every 3rd even number:
     \[
     2, 5, 8, \ldots, 2022
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1011}{3} = 337 \) terms.

6. **Combining the Counts:**
   - The total number of elements in \( S \) is the sum of the odd and even counts:
     \[
     144 + 337 = 481
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum possible number of elements in \( S \) is \( \boxed{481} \).

Here's a breakdown of the solution process:

**Understanding the Constraints:**

* **General Case (Distinct Elements):**  For any distinct elements 'x' and 'y' within set S, the difference between them must be greater than 2. 
* **Odd Element Case:** For distinct odd elements 'x' and 'y' in set S, the difference between them must be greater than 6.

**Finding Odd Numbers:**

* The odd numbers from 1 to 2024 form an arithmetic sequence with first term (a) = 1, common difference (d) = 2, and last term (l) = 2023. 
* We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a + (n-1)d  

**Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers:**

* The number of terms (n) in this sequence can be found using the formula: a_n = a + (n-1)d 
* Setting a_n = 2023, we get: 2023 = 1 + (n-1) * 2
* Solving for n:  2022 = (n-1)*2, therefore n = 1011.

Therefore, there are 1011 odd numbers in the set.


**Applying Constraints:**

To find the maximum number of elements 'S' while satisfying both constraints, we need to consider which odd numbers from the sequence can satisfy the greater-than-6 constraint and how many such elements we could include within our set.  

The fact that all odd numbers are greater than 6 apart helps us quickly determine the possible numbers for the set S.

Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Integers a, b, and c satisfy ab + c = 10, bc + a = 87, and ca + b = 60. What is ab + bc + ca?

Using exemplars:
1. We are given three equations involving integers a, b, and c:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Adding these three equations together gives us the sum of all products of two different numbers from a, b, and c, plus an extra copy of each number:
   - (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
   - ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

3. We want to find the value of ab + bc + ca, but we have an extra term with c + a + b. However, since we know that (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 157, and each number appears exactly once in each equation, then:
   - c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

4. Now, let's subtract the extra term from our previous sum:
   - (ab + bc + ca + c + a + b) - (c + a + b) = 157 - (c + a + b)
   - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 157

5. To find the value of ab + bc + ca, we can divide both sides by 2:
   - ab + bc + ca = 157 / 2

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: A bee moves in 3D space based on die rolls (A+/A- for x, B+/B- for y, C+/C- for z). Starting at origin with 4 rolls, what's the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand that a die roll can result in any number from 1 to 6 (since it's not specified otherwise). However, in the context of this problem, each roll represents a step along the x, y, or z axis of a unit cube. So, we are only interested in whether a roll results in a positive (+) or negative (-) step.
2. For the bee to traverse 4 distinct edges of a unit cube starting from the origin and moving in 3D space based on die rolls, it means that each axis (x, y, z) should have at least one positive and one negative step. The order of these steps doesn't matter.
3. Now, let's calculate the probability of this happening:
   a. Probability of rolling a positive or negative step on any axis is 1/2 (since there are two outcomes - + and -).
   b. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each axis to get the overall probability.
4. Therefore, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges is:
$$ \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} $$

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

* The bee moves in 3D space based on dice rolls (A+/A-, B+/B-, C+/C-). These represent positive or negative steps in each dimension (x, y, z).
* We want to find the probability of the bee successfully moving to 4 distinct edges of a unit cube.

**2. Probability of Each Axis:**

* For each axis (x, y, z), we have two possible outcomes: + or -. 
* The probability of rolling either + or - for each direction is **1/2**. 


**3.  Probability of Traversing Edges:**

* We need to consider all the possible combinations of dice rolls that could lead to 4 distinct edges (as the bee's steps are independent, we can think about it in terms of combinations).
* Since there are three axes (x, y, z) each with two possible outcomes (+ or -), the total number of possibilities is $2^3 = 8$

**4. Calculating the Probability:**

* The probability of traversing a single edge is based on the number of successful steps for a particular axis and independent dice rolls.
* For example, to get the x-axis edge, we'll need one step in positive or negative direction, so there are 2 possible outcomes (positive or negative)
* The probability of getting exactly one step in either direction is $1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4$ for the x axis.


 **5. Final Calculation**

The total probability of traversing 4 distinct edges will be: 
$$ 8 \times (1/4) $$ 
$$= 2 $$



 
**Therefore, the final answer is:** $2$ $$

3. Therefore, we can write the equation: N = 1013 + 1012.

**Understanding the Relationship**

The key insight is that being the 1013th person from the left means they are also the 1010th person from the right.  This means there's an equal number of people on both sides of this individual. 

* **Think about it this way:** If you move from the 1010th position to the right, and someone is at that exact same spot in a line, they are now on the left side.


**Setting up the Equation**

Let's represent the total number of people in the line as 'N'.  
* The person in the middle (1010th from the right) will be 1012 steps away from either end of the line.
* We can write this as: N = 1013 + 1012

  "Here's the solution process for finding the number of ordered pairs satisfying the equation:\n\n**1. Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n   Similar to the previous example, start with the original equation: \n   √(n² - 49) = m\n\n**2. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n  The goal is to find all possible integer values for (m, n) that satisfy this equation, meaning the square root of  'n²-49' equals 'm'.  This suggests we might be looking for pairs where one number 'n' relates to another 'm' in such a way that the square root of 'n² - 49' is equal to 'm'.\n\n**3.

  "Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step, just as you asked for in the example solution:\n\n**1. Find the Range:**\n\n* Similar to the previous example, we need to find the range of values where M can be.  Since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares, their difference must be a multiple of an integer 'n'.\n* To simplify, let's find what numbers would make the difference between two consecutive perfect square (like (M+1213)-(M+1213-1))  equal to some number. For example, take a look at 40 * 40 = 1600 and 41* 41 = 1681.\n \n**2.

  "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:** We are given that  *a*, 720, and *b* form a geometric sequence with *a* < 720 < *b*.  We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of *b*.\n\n**2. Finding 'a'**: Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{720}{a} = r \\quad \\text{(common ratio)} \n    \\]\n   Given that *a* < 720, and to maximize *a* (minimize the common ratio), we choose the largest integer factor of `720` less than `720`. The prime factorization of `720` is:\n    \\[\n    720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n    \\]\n   Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is `80` (since `90 > 720`).  So:\n    \\[\n    a = \\frac{720}{80} = 9 \n    \\] \n\n**3. Finding 'b'**: Now that we have *a* = 9, then:\n    \\[\n    b = 720 \\times r = 720 \\times \\frac{720}{9}\n    \\]\n   Simplifying further, we find:\n    \\[\n    b = 720 \\times \\frac{80}{1} = 57600\n    \\]\n\n**4.
