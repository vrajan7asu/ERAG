Question 1/20 (ID: 1):
Q: What is the value of 9901*101 - 99*10101?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factor out the common term, which is 101:
   9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = 101 * (9901 - 99)

2. Now, calculate the difference inside the parentheses:
   9901 - 99 = 9802

3. Then, multiply this result by 101:
   101 * 9802 = $$1009902$$

Let's follow the same steps as in the example:

1. Factor out the common term, which is 101:
   9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = 101 * (9901 - 99)

Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form T = aL + bG, where a and b are constants, T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, as well as if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b. We can do this by setting up two equations using the given information:

For the first hike: T = aL + bG => 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   For the second hike: T = aL + bG => T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

T2 - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800) => T2 - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300)

3. Let's denote T2 as X (it's just for simplicity). So, we have:

X - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300) ...(Equation 1)
   And from the first equation we have:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) ...(Equation 2)

4. Now, we can solve these two equations for a and b. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.5 and Equation 2 by -0.3:

1.5X - 69*1.5 = a(-0.3 * 1.5) + b(300 * 1.5) => 1.5X - 103.5 = a(-0.45) + b(450) ...(Equation 3)
   And from Equation 2 we have:
   -0.3*69 = a(1.5 * -0.3) + b(800 * -0.3) => -20.7 = a(-0.45) + b(-240) ...(Equation 4)

5. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   1.5X - 103.5 - 20.7 = 0 => 1.5X = 124.2 => X = $89.467$ (approximately)

6. Now that we have the value of T2, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a and b. Let's use Equation 2:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) => 69 - 1.5a = 800b => a/b = (800b)/(69-1.5a)
   But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that T2 is actually approximately 90 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   90 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 90 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(90-1.2a)
   Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (90-1.2a)
   Solving this equation gives us:
   a = $0.056$, b = $0.078$

7. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   T = aL + bG => T = 0.056*4.2 + 0.078*4000 => T = $312$ minutes (approximately)

So, the model estimates that it will take approximately \boxed{312} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

Here's the solution:

1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b. We can do this by setting up two equations using the given information:

For the first hike: T = aL + bG => 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   For the second hike: T = aL + bG => T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

T2 - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800) => T2 - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300)

3. Let's denote T2 as X (it's just for simplicity). So, we have:

X - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300) ...(Equation 1)
   And from the first equation we have:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) ...(Equation 2)

4. Now, we can solve these two equations for a and b. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.5 and Equation 2 by -0.3:

1.5X - 69*1.5 = a(-0.3 * 1.5) + b(300 * 1.5) => 1.5X - 103.5 = a(-0.45) + b(450) ...(Equation 3)
   And from Equation 2 we have:
   -0.3*69 = a(1.5 * -0.3) + b(800 * -0.3) => -20.7 = a(-0.45) + b(-240) ...(Equation 4)

5. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   1.5X - 103.5 - 20.7 = 0 => 1.5X = 124.2 => X = $82.8$ (approximately)

However, since we have the value of T2 as an option, let's assume it to be approximately 90 minutes:

6. Let's use Equation 2:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) => 69 - 1.5a = 800b => a/b = (800b)/(69-1.5a)
   But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's use the value of T2 as an option:
   90 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 90 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(90-1.2a)

7. Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (90-1.2a)
   Solving this equation gives us:
   a = $0.051$, b = $0.071$

8. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   T = aL + bG => T = 0.051*4.2 + 0.071*4000

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand what a "prime" number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Next, let's find the smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
3. If we add up these first five primes (2+3+5+7+11), we get 28. However, 28 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (it can be divided by 4).
4. So, we need to find another combination of five distinct primes that sum up to a prime number. The next possible combination is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. But again, 49 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 7.
5. Continuing this process, we eventually find the combination (2+3+5+11+17), which sums up to 38. This is still not a prime number.
6. Finally, we reach the combination (2+3+5+11+19), which sums up to 40. This is also not a prime number.
7. Moving on, we try (2+3+5+17+19), which sums up to 46. Again, this is not a prime number.
8. The next combination we try is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. This is also not a prime number.
9. We continue this process until we find the combination (2+3+5+11+23), which sums up to 44. Again, this is not a prime number.
10. Finally, we reach the combination (3+5+7+13+17), which sums up to 45. This is also not a prime number.
11. We continue this process until we find that no other combination of five distinct primes will sum up to a prime number. Therefore, the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes does not exist.

## Step 1: Understand what we're looking for
We need to find the smallest prime number that can be expressed as the sum of five distinct prime numbers.

## Step 2: List the first few prime numbers
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc. These will be used to form combinations.

## Step 3: Attempt different combinations of five distinct primes
We need to try various combinations of the first few prime numbers and sum them up to see if the result is a prime number.

## Step 4: Check for each combination if it's a prime number or not
Starting with the smallest combinations:
- (2+3+5+7+11) = 28, which is not a prime.
- (3+5+7+11+13) = 49, which is also not a prime.

## Step 5: Continue checking other combinations until we find one that sums up to a prime
We continue the process:
- (2+3+5+11+17) = 38, not a prime.
- (2+3+5+11+19) = 40, also not a prime.
- (2+3+5+17+19) = 46, still not a prime.
- The next combinations in order are checked similarly until we find one that sums to a prime.

## Step 6: Upon reaching combination (2+3+5+11+23), it does not sum up to a prime number
Following the pattern, the combination of (2+3+5+11+23) is checked and found not to be a prime.

## Step 7: However, we made an error in our approach so far; since no other combinations are given as examples, let's correct the process by focusing on finding the actual smallest sum first
We realize that our previous steps didn't actually reach a point where we concluded the search correctly. Let's adjust our strategy to ensure we exhaust all possibilities systematically.

## Step 8: Given the error in step 6, let's approach it with an open mind and continue evaluating combinations until we find one that satisfies the condition
We will go through this process correctly and find a valid combination.

## Step 9: After evaluating numerous combinations, let's identify the smallest prime number that can be written as the sum of five distinct primes correctly.
Upon proper evaluation:
- We notice an error in our method; each step after the first should incrementally check new sums without assuming they will not work. Since we're tasked to find a specific outcome based on examples given, let's correct course and assume no combination works.

## Step 10: Given that all attempts lead to non-prime numbers as their sum, deduce that our final answer must be about what was found with this process.
However, there seems to have been confusion in steps due to an incorrect conclusion from the initial problem setup. Let's correct course by understanding the premise provided initially.

## Step 11: Realizing that no combination of five distinct primes sums up to a prime number based on given examples and following instructions correctly
The smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of five distinct primes, according to the detailed analysis in the problem statement itself, does not exist because all combinations tried result in non-prime numbers.

## Step 12: Conclude that since no valid combination exists for the sum being a prime, we cannot derive an answer following the example's logic without assuming incorrect premises or steps.
This process leads us to understand there was a misunderstanding of what was asked and how it was approached initially. Given this confusion, let's correct course by re-reading instructions carefully.

## Step 13: Upon reflection, note that since the sum cannot be prime if all other sums are not prime from given examples, this actually suggests we may have overcomplicated things
Actually, there is a key point in the initial problem statement which we overlooked due to rushing into an incorrect sequence of steps without properly following instructions.

## Step 14: Correct the approach by accepting that our premise was flawed from the start because all combinations led us away from finding what we needed; which actually matches the conclusion drawn from examples given.
This indicates a misstep in reasoning. Let's correct it by stating there is no smallest prime number as per the question setup and analysis.

## Step 15: Given this realization that our process was misguided due to misunderstanding of what the problem required, we should have instead focused on accepting the outcome from provided examples directly
Realizing now the initial logic flow contained errors that led us astray from solving what was asked correctly. This means we must align with the given solution's conclusion without incorrect assumptions.

## Step 16: Upon review of our own process and recognizing the misinterpretation of how to tackle this problem based on the information provided, it seems there was confusion about reaching a valid prime sum through the combinations checked
Given that no combination adds up to a prime number according to steps analyzed incorrectly initially.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: The number 2024 is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by identifying that we need to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers, where these numbers may repeat.
2. The maximum value for each two-digit number is 99, so the minimum number of such numbers needed can be found by dividing 2024 by 99 and rounding up since we are dealing with integers: 
   \[
   \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44 \Rightarrow 21
   \]
3. To confirm if 21 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024, consider using the highest possible value for each, which is 99:
   \[
   21 \times 99 = 2079
   \]
   This exceeds 2024. Therefore, we need more than 21 numbers, but let's check if 22 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.
4. If each number was 99, the sum would be:
   \[
   22 \times 99 = 2178
   \]
   We now reduce values of some numbers below 99 to achieve the exact sum of 2024. For example, setting two numbers to 52 instead of 99 gives us:
   \[
   20 \times 99 + 2 \times 52 = 1980 + 104 = 2084
   \]
   This is still too high. Instead, using the strategy of replacing two numbers with lower values might work better. Let's consider reducing two pairs:
   
   - Replace the first pair (99, 99) with (52, 52):
     \[
     1980 + 4 = 1984 \quad (\text{closer but still high})
     \]
   - Now replace another pair with (52, 52), we get:
     \[
     1984 + 4 = 2024 \quad (\text{exact sum achieved})
     \]
   
   The above strategy works, and indeed, 20 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

Question 5/20 (ID: 5):
Q: What is the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's factorize 2024 into its prime factors. 2024 = 2^3 * 7 * 11
2. For n! to be a multiple of 2024, it must contain at least three factors of 2 (because 2024 has three factors of 2), one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.
3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is when n = 11, because 11! will contain all the necessary factors: three factors of 2 (from 2, 4, and 8), one factor of 7 (from 7), and one factor of 11 (from 11).
4. Therefore, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is \boxed{11}

To find the smallest value of n, we'll follow the same steps as in the example:

1. Factorize 2024 into its prime factors:
2024 = 2^3 * 7 * 11

2. For n! to be a multiple of 2024, it must contain at least three factors of 2 (because 2024 has three factors of 2), one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.

3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is when n = 11, because:
   - It will have three factors of 2: from 2, 4, and 8 (since 10! has 5 factors of 2 and we only need 3).
   - It will have one factor of 7: from 7.
   - It will have one factor of 11: from 11.

However, considering that we actually only need three factors of 2 in n!, we can consider values less than 11. For example:
- At n = 10, the product contains two factors of 2 (from 4 and 8) which is not enough.
- At n = 9, the product still lacks one factor of 2.

But when n = 10 or greater, we can find that we will have at least three factors of 2. However, what about other prime numbers? We also need to consider n such that it contains a factor of 7 and one factor of 11 in its factorial product. 

In this case, let's try the next number after 10 which has these prime factors included: 
   - From 11 itself we have our required factors of 2.
   - We also get one factor of 7 from 7.

Question 6/20 (ID: 6):
Q: What is the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We need to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using swaps of adjacent letters. The goal is to find the minimum number of such swaps.
2. To solve this, we can visualize the problem as a graph where each letter is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are adjacent in the string and can be swapped.
3. We can start by looking at the first and last letters (A and F). Since they are not adjacent, we need to swap them with other letters. The closest non-adjacent letter to A is D, so we swap A and D, making the string BCDFA.
4. Now, let's look at the new first and last letters (B and F). They are still not adjacent, but we can swap F and C to get BCADF.
5. Finally, we can swap A and D again to get the desired string FEDCBA.
6. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required is 3.

$$ \boxed{3} $$

To solve this problem, let's follow the same approach as before.

1. First, we need to understand the problem. We want to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using successive swaps of adjacent letters.
2. Let's visualize the problem as a graph where each letter is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are adjacent in the string and can be swapped.
3. Since the goal is to move A to the end and F to the beginning, we should focus on these two letters first.

Initially:
A B C D E F

We need to swap A with one of its non-adjacent neighbors. The closest non-adjacent neighbor to A is D (distance 2), so let's swap A and D:
D B C A F E

Now, we have swapped the positions of A and D. We still need to move A to the end and F to the beginning.

New string: DBCAFE
We can now look at the new first and last letters (D and E). They are not adjacent, so we need to swap them with other letters. The closest non-adjacent letter to D is B, but it's better to swap E and C to make room for A to move to the end:
DBFCEA

Now that E has moved next to F, let's swap these two letters:
DFBCEA

Finally, we can move A to its final position by swapping it with B:
FEDCBA

Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required is 3.

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: The product of three integers is 60. What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the factors of 60 that could potentially be the three integers. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

2. To minimize the sum of these integers, we should choose the smallest possible factors that multiply to give 60. The smallest possible set of three factors is 1, 2, and 30 because their product is 60 (1 * 2 * 30 = 60) and their sum is the smallest among all possible combinations of factors.

3. So, the least possible positive sum of the three integers is 1 + 2 + 30 = 33.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{33}.

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria work in a chocolate factory. On Monday Amy, Bomani, and Charlie started working at 1:00 PM and were able to pack 4, 3, and 3 packages, respectively, every 3 minutes. At some later time, Daria joined the group, and Daria was able to pack 5 packages every 4 minutes. Together, they finished packing 450 packages at exactly 2:45 PM. At what time did Daria join the group?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them. They worked for 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM).

Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, she would have packed $4 \times (45/3) = 60$ packages.
Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.
Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.

2. Together, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed $60 + 45 + 45 = 150$ packages before Daria joined them.

3. Now let's find out when Daria started working. We know that after she joined, they finished packing the remaining 450 - 150 = 300 packages.

4. Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so to pack 300 packages, it would take her $300 / 5 = 60$ minutes. Since they finished packing at 2:45 PM, Daria must have joined them 1 hour before this time, which is at 1:45 PM.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{1:45} $$ was the time when Daria joined the group.

## Step 1
First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them.

Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, she would have packed $4 \times (45/3) = 60$ packages.
Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.
Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.

## Step 2
Together, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed $60 + 45 + 45 = 150$ packages before Daria joined them.

## Step 3
Now let's find out when Daria started working. We know that after she joined, they finished packing the remaining $450 - 150 = 300$ packages.

## Step 4
Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so to pack 300 packages, it would take her $\frac{300}{5} = 60$ minutes. Since they finished packing at exactly 2:45 PM, Daria must have joined them 1 hour before this time.

## Step 5
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to subtract 60 from 2:45 PM to find the time when Daria joined the group.

## Step 6
So, 2:45 PM - 1 hour = 1:45 PM. Therefore, $$\boxed{1:45}$$ was the time when Daria joined the group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1:45}$

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: In how many ways can 6 juniors and 6 seniors form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to select 2 juniors out of 6 for the first team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
2. After selecting 2 juniors for the first team, we have 4 juniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 6 for the second team. The number of ways to do this is also given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
3. Now, we have 4 juniors and 4 seniors left. We need to select 2 juniors out of 4 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 4 is C(4, 2).
4. Similarly, we have 2 seniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 2 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 2 is C(2, 2).
5. Finally, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)} $$

4. Similarly, we have 2 seniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 2 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 2 is C(2, 2).

C(2, 2) = (2 × 1) / (2 × 1) = 1

5. Finally, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors.

Total number of ways = C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)
= 15 * 15 * 6 * 1
= 1350

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Consider the following operation. Given a positive integer n, if n is a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n/3. If n is not a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n+10. Then continue this process. Suppose you start with n=100. What value results if you perform this operation exactly 100 times?

Using exemplars:
1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.
2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110 + 10 = 120.
3. Continue this process:
   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 120 + 10 = 130.
   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130 + 10 = 140.
   - n = 140 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140 + 10 = 150.
   - n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.
4. Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.
5. Continue this process:
   - n = 60 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
6. Now n = 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.
7. Continue this process:
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
8. We can see that the operation will keep oscillating between 10 and 30, but since the question asks for the result after exactly 100 operations, we need to continue this process for 100 times. However, it's clear that the operation will always result in either 10 or 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division).
9. Since the operation is performed an even number of times (100), the final result will be determined by whether we end up with n = 10 or n = 30 after the first 98 operations. This depends on the remainder when dividing 98 by 2 (since the pattern repeats every two operations).
10. The remainder when dividing 98 by 2 is 0, which means we will end up with n = 30 after the first 98 operations. Then, in the last two operations, we perform one addition and one division:
    - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
    - n = 10 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.

The final answer is \boxed{20}.

Let's follow the same steps as in the example:

1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110.
2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 120.
3. Continue this process:
   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130.
   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140.
   - ...
   We continue adding 10 to n until we reach a multiple of 3.

4. After some additions, we will eventually reach a number that is a multiple of 3. Let's say after k operations, we get:
n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.
Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 60.

5. We can see that after k operations, the value of n will be between 50 and 150 (inclusive). And since each operation increases or decreases the value of n by a factor of 3/1 = 3, we can divide this range into three equal parts.

6. Let's analyze what happens in each part:
   - In the first part (50 ≤ n ≤ 60), after one operation, n becomes a multiple of 3 and is divided by 3.
   - In the second part (60 ≤ n ≤ 100), after two operations, n becomes a multiple of 3 and is divided by 3.
   - In the third part (100 ≤ n ≤ 150), after three operations, n becomes a multiple of 3 and is divided by 3.

7. Since we are performing this operation exactly 100 times, we can determine how many operations fall into each part:
   - The first part has 10 operations (50 to 60).
   - The second part has 20 operations (60 to 100).
   - The third part has 70 operations (100 to 150).

8. We are interested in the final result after all these operations, so we need to look at what happens in the last operation.
Since we have a total of 100 operations and each operation takes us from one multiple of 3 to another multiple of 3, the final value will be determined by which multiple of 3 we end up with.

9. Since we start with n = 100, after an even number of operations (98), we will end up with a value that is either 10 more or 10 less than 100.
Since there are three parts and each part has the same length, this means we will end up with a multiple of 3 that is either 10 more or 10 less than 100.

10. Now let's look at what happens in the last operation:
   - If n = 110 (a multiple of 3), then n / 3 = 110 / 3 = 36 + remainder.
   - If n = 90 (a multiple of 3), then n / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30.

However, this is the wrong way to solve it. We can find the correct solution by observing that since we are adding 10 to n whenever n is not a multiple of 3 and dividing n by 3 whenever n is a multiple of 3, every two operations will either increase or decrease the value of n by a factor of 1/3, because after one addition (when n was not a multiple of 3), we follow it with one division (when n becomes a multiple of 3 again).

We have performed this operation exactly 100 times, which is an even number. Therefore, the final result will be determined by what happens in every two operations.

Since we are starting with n = 100 and each pair of operations increases or decreases the value of n by a factor of 1/3, we can simply observe that after 50 pairs of operations (n = 100), we end up with a number between 30 and 60, which is a multiple of 3.

Therefore, after all 100 operations are performed, we will have divided the original value of n by 1/3^(50) times. Since 1/3^50 is a very small value, we can neglect it and conclude that:

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: How many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m?

Using exemplars:
1. We start with the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. Since m is an integer, it means that n^2 - 49 must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as k^2. So, we have n^2 - 49 = k^2.

3. Rearranging the equation gives us n^2 = k^2 + 49, or (n-k)(n+k) = 49.

4. The factors of 49 are ±1, ±7, and ±49. So, we have six possible pairs for (n-k, n+k): (1, 49), (-1, -49), (7, 42), (-7, -42), (49, 1), and (-49, -1).

5. For each pair of (n-k, n+k), we can solve for n and m:
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (1, 49), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-1, -49), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (7, 42), then n = 24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-7, -42), then n = -24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (49, 1), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-49, -1), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.

6. So, there are four ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation: (25, 25), (25, -25), (-25, 25), and (-25, -25).

   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-49, -1), then n is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.

6. So, there are only two ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation: (25, 25) and (25, -25).

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations from this list (translation 2 units right, 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin, reflection across x-axis, dilation at origin with scale factor 2), how many commute?

Using exemplars:
1. A transformation commutes if it doesn't matter in which order you apply the transformations. This means that applying transformation T followed by transformation R should yield the same result as applying transformation R followed by transformation T.
2. Translation 2 units right is a linear transformation, and it does not affect the other transformations (since translation is an isometry). Therefore, it can commute with all transformations.
3. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This transformation commutes with reflection across x-axis because a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection across the y-axis, and vice versa. However, it does not commute with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling.
4. Reflection across x-axis: This transformation commutes with 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin (as mentioned in step 3). It also commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because reflecting followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by reflecting.
5. Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This transformation does not commute with any other transformations on this list, as scaling affects the outcome of the other transformations (translation and rotation).
6. Based on our analysis, only three pairs of distinct transformations commute (translation with reflection, translation with dilation, and reflection with 90-degree rotation). The final answer is $ \boxed{3} $.

To determine the number of pairs of transformations that commute, we need to analyze each pair.

1. Translation 2 units right commutes with:
	* 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin (since translation is an isometry and doesn't affect the outcome)
	* Reflection across x-axis (translation followed by reflection has the same effect as reflection followed by translation)
	* Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (translation followed by scaling has the same effect as scaling followed by translation)
2. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin commutes with:
	* Reflection across x-axis (as mentioned in step 1)
	* Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 (rotation followed by scaling would have a different outcome than scaling followed by rotation, so they don't commute)

However, considering only distinct pairs of transformations:

1. Translation 2 units right commutes with:
	* Reflection across x-axis
	* Dilation at origin with scale factor 2
2. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin commutes with:
	* Reflection across x-axis

Dilation at origin with scale factor 2 does not commute with any of the other transformations in this list.

Therefore, the number of pairs of distinct transformations that commute is:

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: Let M be the greatest integer such that both M + 1213 and M + 3773 are perfect squares. What is the unit digit of M?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies. Since both M+1213 and M+3773 are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.

2. The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference: sqrt(2560/2) = 41 (since 41*41 = 1681 and 42*42 = 1764, which are both greater than our range).

3. Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over: (sqrt(1213)-41)^2 < M < (sqrt(3773)-41)^2 => 904 < M < 2560.

4. Since we're looking for the unit digit of M, we can narrow down our search to numbers between 904 and 2560 with specific unit digits. The possible units digits for perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

5. Testing these values, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.

6. The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.

## Step 1: First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies.
To do this, let's consider the difference between M+1213 and M+3773. Since both are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.

## Step 2: The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference.
Taking the square root of half the difference gives us sqrt(2560/2) = sqrt(1280). After calculating this we get 40.27 (approximately), but since we need an integer, we take the next whole number which is 41.

## Step 3: Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over.
To find these bounds, let's first find the perfect squares around 1213. We can see that sqrt(1212) = 34.88 and sqrt(1214) = 35. The next step is finding the square of a number just above this, which gives us 40^2 = 1600 > 1213.

## Step 4: Now we know the lower bound for M.
Next, let's find the perfect squares around 3773. We can see that sqrt(3769) = 61.38 and sqrt(3775) = 61.49. The next step is finding the square of a number just above this which gives us 62^2 = 3844 > 3773.

## Step 5: Since we know the range for M, let's now consider what values it could be.
M has to be an integer that fits between two perfect squares: one less than or equal to 1213 and another that is more than 3773 but not exceeding it.

## Step 6: The possible units digits for a perfect square are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
We need the unit digit of M. So let's look at numbers between our lower bound (906) and upper bound (2560). Since we're looking for perfect squares in this range that also satisfy both conditions for n and being a difference of two perfect squares, it would make sense to test some values around those ranges.

## Step 7: Testing these possible unit digits for M, let's see if any perfect squares in the given range meet the criteria.
M must be an integer such that both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares. We need to test all the unit digit options.

## Step 8: Finding a possible solution
After testing these possibilities, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.

## Step 9: Finding the unit digit of M.
The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: For a two-out-of-three playoff with Team A having 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away, if Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, and p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)) where m,n are positive integers, what is m + n?

Using exemplars:
1. Team A has a 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away. Since it's a two-out-of-three playoff, we need to consider the scenarios where Team A wins exactly two games out of three.

2. There are two possible ways for Team A to win two games:
   a) Win both games at home (2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 chance).
   b) Win one game at home and one game away ((2/3)*p + (1-2/3)*(1-p)).

3. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, so we can set up an equation: 4/9 + (2/3)*p + (1/3)*(1-p) = 1/2.

4. Solving this equation for p gives us: p = 1/6 * (m - sqrt(n)).

5. Since m and n are positive integers, we can find possible values by trial and error. One such solution is m=5 and n=4.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{5+4=9} $$

To solve for the values of $m$ and $n$, we need to follow a similar process as in the example. However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement since the equation for $p$ should have been derived from the overall probability of Team A winning two out of three games, not the equation given.

Let's derive it correctly:

1. There are two possible ways for Team A to win exactly two games:
   a) Win both games at home (2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 chance).
   b) Win one game at home and one game away ((2/3)*p + (1-2/3)*(1-p)).

2. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, so we can set up an equation: 
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) p + \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)(1-p) = \frac{1}{2}. \]

3. Simplifying the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \frac{2}{3}p - \frac{1}{3}p = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4}{9} + \frac{p}{3} = \frac{1}{2}. \]

4. Multiplying through by 18 to clear the fractions:
\[ 8 + 6p = 9. \]

5. Solving for $p$:
\[ 6p = 1, \]
\[ p = \frac{1}{6}. \]

However, this problem states that $p = \frac{1}{2} * (m - \sqrt{n})$. Since we found that $p = \frac{1}{6}$, let's rewrite the equation for $p$:
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} * (m - \sqrt{n}). \]

To get rid of the fraction on the right-hand side, multiply both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2}{6} = m - \sqrt{n}, \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} = m - \sqrt{n}. \]

Now we need to find values for $m$ and $n$ that fit this equation. Since $\sqrt{n}$ is a positive value, let's try making it as small as possible while keeping the other side of the equation equal:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = m - 0 \]
This results in an impossibility since if $m - \sqrt{n} = \frac{1}{3}$ with $\sqrt{n} = 0$, then $\frac{1}{3}$ would not be true.

Let's try another value of $\sqrt{n}$. If we choose a small positive integer for the square root, such as 1 or greater than 1, it results in values that make m impossible to be an integer.
However, if n is not a perfect square and you want to find possible integers by trial and error, let's rewrite our equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = m - \sqrt{n}, \]

Rearrange the equation so we get
\[\sqrt{n}=m-\frac{1}{3}\]
Square both sides:
\[n=\left(m-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2=m^2-{\frac 23}m+\frac{1}{9}.\]
We know $p$ has to be positive, but it's still not clear which value of n would give us a possible m. However, we have
\[\sqrt{n}=m-\frac{1}{3}, \text { and } n = (m-\frac 13)^2.\]

Let's try some small values for $n$, then solve the resulting quadratic equations for $m$.

If $n=1$, the equation becomes:
\[1=m^2-\frac{2}{3}m+\frac{1}{9}\]
Solving this quadratic gives us two roots: $\frac 13, \frac 73$. The problem says that m and n are positive integers. Since neither of these values is an integer, we continue.

If $n=4$, the equation becomes:
\[4=m^2-\frac{2}{3}m+\frac{1}{9}\]
Solving this quadratic gives us two roots: $\frac 93, \frac 53$. The problem says that m and n are positive integers. Since neither of these values is an integer, we continue.

If $n=4$ did not give integer results, let's try a different value for the square root.
Since $m - \sqrt{n}$ must be greater than $\frac{1}{3}$ to produce any possible integer value for $m$, and we have tried making $\sqrt{n} = 0$ and 1, we can keep increasing our square root until it gives us an answer. Since none of the positive integers that are less than or equal to 4 work as solutions to this problem, try values greater than 4.

We know $n=16$, so:
\[ \sqrt{n} = m -\frac{1}{3}. \]
So,
\[ n=m^2-\frac{2m}{3}+\frac{1}{9}\]
Let's plug in a value of $n$ into our equation and see what happens.
This becomes
$$16 =m^2-{\frac 23}m+\frac 19.$$Now we have:
\begin{align*}
0&= m^2 - \frac{2}{3}m + \left(1-\frac 19 \right)\\
&= m^2-\frac{2}{3}m+ \frac89.
\end{align*}

We can factor the left-hand side:
$$(m - \frac23)(m-4)=0.$$This means that either $m = \frac{2}{3}$ or $m = 4$. We see that our m, being a positive integer, must be equal to $\boxed{4}.$

The square root of n is the other variable:
$\sqrt{n}=m-\frac13=4-\frac13=\frac 73$.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
n&=(m-\frac13)^2\\
&=(4-\frac13)^2\\
&= \left(\frac {47}{9}\right)
\end{align*}We need a value for n that is an integer. Therefore, this does not work.

If we want to get closer to our final solution, let's start over and make a new equation:

$$m^2-\frac 23 m+\left(1-\frac19 \right)=n.$$Let's try different values of $m$ and see which ones give us integer results for n.

For the case where $m = 3$, we get:
\begin{align*}
9-{\frac 32} + \frac 89 &= n \\
\Rightarrow \quad \boxed{n=8.5}. 
\end{align*}

For the case where $m = 4$ as before, we have already seen that it does not work.

Let's try to get closer still.
If we plug in m = 5 into our equation, then:
\begin{align*}
25- \frac52+\frac 89 &=n\\
\Rightarrow\quad n&=8.2.
\end{align*}

We want integer values for $n$.

Let's try to find some other positive integer solutions by trial and error with different m values.
For example, if we plug in m = 6:
\begin{align*}
36-4+ \frac89 &= n\\
\Rightarrow \quad \boxed{n=8}.
\end{align*}

The problem asks for the final answer to be: $$answer$$.
We want the value of $m + n$. Therefore, our answer is: $$6 + 8 = \boxed{14}.$$

Question 15/20 (ID: 15):
Q: There are exactly K positive integers b with 5 <= b <= 2024 such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16. What is the sum of the digits of K?

Using exemplars:
1. A number is divisible by 16 if its last two digits are divisible by 16. This means that we need to find all base-b integers from 5 to 2024 (inclusive) such that the last two digits of their decimal representation are divisible by 16.
2. Since there is only one digit position in the range [5, 2024], we only need to check if each number in this range has a last digit that is divisible by 16.
3. We can start by listing all numbers from 5 to 2024 and checking their last digits:
   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (which is divisible by 16), 17, ..., 2024.
4. We can see that every 16th number from the right has a last digit that is divisible by 16. Therefore, we need to count how many numbers in this range satisfy this condition.
5. To do this, we can divide the difference between the largest and smallest numbers (2024 - 5) by 16 and round up to the nearest integer: (2024 - 5) / 16 = 126.4375, which rounds up to 127.
6. Therefore, there are K = 127 positive integers b such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16.
7. Finally, we need to find the sum of the digits of K:
   1 + 2 + 7 = 10.
8. The final answer is $ \boxed{10} $.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers a, 720 and b, where a < 720 < b. What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that `a`, `720`, and `b` form a geometric sequence with `a < 720 < b`. We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of `b`.
   
2. **Finding `a`**: Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:
   \[
   \frac{720}{a} = r \quad \text{(common ratio)}
   \]
   Given that `a < 720`, and to maximize `a` (minimize the common ratio), we choose the largest integer factor of `720` less than `720`. The prime factorization of `720` is:
   \[
   720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5
   \]
   Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is `80` (since `90 > 720`). So:
   \[
   a = \frac{720}{9} = 80 \quad \text{(not valid, as 80 < 720)}
   \]
   Correcting the mistake, we should choose \( a = 45 \) instead (as it is the largest integer factor less than 720 that also results in a geometric sequence).

3. **Finding `b`**: Now that we have `a = 45`, then:
   \[
   b = 720 \times r = 720 \times \frac{720}{45}
   \]
   Simplifying further, we find:
   \[
   b = 720 \times \frac{16}{1} = 9600
   \]

4. **Sum of Digits**: The digits in `b` are `9`, `6`, `0`, and `0`. Summing these gives:
   \[
   9 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of the digits of the least possible value of `b` is $\boxed{15}$.

To find the least possible value of `b`, we need to maximize `a` and minimize the common ratio.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given that `a`, `720`, and `b` form a geometric sequence with `a < 720 < b`. We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of `b`.

## Step 2: Finding `a`
Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:

\[
720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5
\]
Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is indeed `80`, so we should use it as `a`.

## Step 3: Finding `b`
Now that we have `a = 80`, then:
\[
r = \frac{720}{80} = 9
\]
Thus,
\[
b = 720 \times r = 720 \times 9 = 6480

The digits in `b` are `6`, `4`, `8`, and `0`. Summing these gives:
\[
6 + 4 + 8 + 0 = 18

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: Let S be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 2024} such that for distinct elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 2, and for distinct odd elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 6. What is the maximum possible number of elements in S?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The set \( S \) is a subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \).
   - For distinct elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 2 \).
   - For distinct odd elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 6 \).

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers:**
   - The odd numbers in the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \) are:
     \[
     1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023
     \]
   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and last term \( l = 2023 \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers:**
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a + (n-1)d
     \]
     Setting \( a_n = 2023 \):
     \[
     2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n-1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 1012 odd numbers in the set.

4. **Applying the Odd Number Constraint:**
   - Since the difference between any two distinct odd elements must be greater than 6, we can select every 7th odd number to maximize the count:
     \[
     1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1012}{7} = 144 \) terms.

5. **Applying the Even Number Constraint:**
   - For even numbers, the difference must be greater than 2. We can select every 3rd even number:
     \[
     2, 5, 8, \ldots, 2022
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1011}{3} = 337 \) terms.

6. **Combining the Counts:**
   - The total number of elements in \( S \) is the sum of the odd and even counts:
     \[
     144 + 337 = 481
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum possible number of elements in \( S \) is \( \boxed{481} \).

We are given a subset \(S\) of the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\}\) with two constraints:
- For distinct elements \(x, y \in S\), the absolute difference \(|x-y|\) must be greater than 2.
- For distinct odd elements \(x, y \in S\), the absolute difference \(|x-y|\) must be greater than 6.

## Step 2: Identifying Odd Numbers
To find the number of odd numbers in the given set, we consider the arithmetic sequence formed by odd numbers:
\[1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023\]
This sequence has a first term \(a = 1\), common difference \(d = 2\), and last term \(l = 2023\).

## Step 3: Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers
Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]
Setting \(a_n = 2023\) to solve for \(n\):
\[2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2\]
Solving for \(n\):
\[2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n - 1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012\]

## Step 4: Applying the Odd Number Constraint
To maximize the count of odd numbers, we select every 7th odd number:
\[1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015\]
This sequence has \(\frac{1012}{7} = 144\) terms.

- For distinct elements \(x, y \in S\), the absolute difference \(|x-y|\) must be greater than 2.
- For distinct odd elements \(x, y \in S\), the absolute difference \(|x-y|\) must be greater than 6.

## Step 2: Identifying Odd Numbers
To find the number of odd numbers in the given set, we consider the arithmetic sequence formed by odd numbers:
\[1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023\]
This sequence has a first term \(a = 1\), common difference \(d = 2\), and last term \(l = 2023\).

## Step 3: Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers
Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]
Setting \(a_n = 2023\) to solve for \(n\):
\[2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2\]
Solving for \(n\):
\[2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n - 1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012\]

## Step 4: Applying the Odd Number Constraint
To maximize the count of odd numbers, we select every 7th odd number:
\[1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015\]
This sequence has \(\frac{1012}{7} = 144\) terms.

## Step 5: Applying the Even Number Constraint
For even numbers, we can select every 3rd even number:
\[2, 5, 8, \ldots, 2022\]
This sequence has \(\frac{1011}{3} = 337\) terms.

## Step 6: Combining the Counts
The total number of elements in \(S\) is the sum of the odd and even counts:
\[144 + 337 = 481\]

The final answer is: $\boxed{481}$ vs Expected: 608 | Accuracy: 5.9%


Question 18/20 (ID: 18):
Q: Integers a, b, and c satisfy ab + c = 10, bc + a = 87, and ca + b = 60. What is ab + bc + ca?

Using exemplars:
1. We are given three equations involving integers a, b, and c:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Adding these three equations together gives us the sum of all products of two different numbers from a, b, and c, plus an extra copy of each number:
   - (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
   - ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

3. We want to find the value of ab + bc + ca, but we have an extra term with c + a + b. However, since we know that (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 157, and each number appears exactly once in each equation, then:
   - c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

4. Now, let's subtract the extra term from our previous sum:
   - (ab + bc + ca + c + a + b) - (c + a + b) = 157 - (c + a + b)
   - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 157

5. To find the value of ab + bc + ca, we can divide both sides by 2:
   - ab + bc + ca = 157 / 2
   - $$ \boxed{78.5} $$

Let's follow the same steps as before.

We are given three equations involving integers a, b, and c:
- ab + c = 10
- bc + a = 87
- ca + b = 60

Adding these three equations together gives us the sum of all products of two different numbers from a, b, and c, plus an extra copy of each number:
(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

We want to find the value of ab + bc + ca, but we have an extra term with c + a + b. However, since we know that (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 157, and each number appears exactly once in each equation, then:
c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

Now, let's subtract the extra term from our previous sum:
(ab + bc + ca + c + a + b) - (c + a + b) = 157 - (c + a + b)
ab + bc + ca = 157 - (c + a + b)

Since each number appears exactly once in each equation, we can notice that the term with c + a + b is actually equal to ab + bc + ca itself. This means:
c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

So, let's substitute this expression into our previous result:
ab + bc + ca = 157 - (ab + bc + ca)

To solve for ab + bc + ca, we can move all terms to one side of the equation and combine like terms:
2(ab + bc + ca) = 157
(ab + bc + ca) = 78.5

So, our final answer is:
$$ \boxed{78.5} $$

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: A bee moves in 3D space based on die rolls (A+/A- for x, B+/B- for y, C+/C- for z). Starting at origin with 4 rolls, what's the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand that a die roll can result in any number from 1 to 6 (since it's not specified otherwise). However, in the context of this problem, each roll represents a step along the x, y, or z axis of a unit cube. So, we are only interested in whether a roll results in a positive (+) or negative (-) step.
2. For the bee to traverse 4 distinct edges of a unit cube starting from the origin and moving in 3D space based on die rolls, it means that each axis (x, y, z) should have at least one positive and one negative step. The order of these steps doesn't matter.
3. Now, let's calculate the probability of this happening:
   a. Probability of rolling a positive or negative step on any axis is 1/2 (since there are two outcomes - + and -).
   b. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each axis to get the overall probability.
4. Therefore, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges is:
$$ \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} $$

1. Similar to the example, each die roll can result in any number from 1 to 6. However, for this problem, we are only interested in whether a roll results in a positive (+) or negative (-) step along the x, y, or z axis of a unit cube.

2. For the bee to traverse 4 distinct edges of a unit cube starting from the origin and moving in 3D space based on die rolls, it means that each axis (x, y, z) should have at least one positive and one negative step. The order of these steps doesn't matter.

   a. Probability of rolling a positive or negative step on any axis is 1/2 (since there are two outcomes - + and -).
   b. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each axis to get the overall probability.
   
The key difference between this problem and the example is that the die rolls now have different labels (A+/A-, B+/B-, C+/C-), but this doesn't change the fact that each roll has two possible outcomes (+ or -) with equal probability.

Therefore, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges remains the same:
$$ \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} $$

Q: In a line of people, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. How many people are in the line?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the total number of people in the line as N.
2. According to the problem, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. This means that there are 1012 people between this person and the end of the line (since the last person isn't counted twice).
3. Therefore, we can write the equation: N = 1013 + 1012.
4. Solving for N gives us N = 2025.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{2025} $$

  "## Step 1: First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies.\nTo do this, let's consider the difference between M+1213 and M+3773. Since both are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.\n\n## Step 2: The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference.\nTaking the square root of half the difference gives us sqrt(2560/2) = sqrt(1280). After calculating this we get 40.27 (approximately), but since we need an integer, we take the next whole number which is 41.\n\n## Step 3: Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over.\nTo find these bounds, let's first find the perfect squares around 1213. We can see that sqrt(1212) = 34.88 and sqrt(1214) = 35. The next step is finding the square of a number just above this, which gives us 40^2 = 1600 > 1213.\n\n## Step 4: Now we know the lower bound for M.\nNext, let's find the perfect squares around 3773. We can see that sqrt(3769) = 61.38 and sqrt(3775) = 61.49. The next step is finding the square of a number just above this which gives us 62^2 = 3844 > 3773.\n\n## Step 5: Since we know the range for M, let's now consider what values it could be.\nM has to be an integer that fits between two perfect squares: one less than or equal to 1213 and another that is more than 3773 but not exceeding it.\n\n## Step 6: The possible units digits for a perfect square are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.\nWe need the unit digit of M. So let's look at numbers between our lower bound (906) and upper bound (2560). Since we're looking for perfect squares in this range that also satisfy both conditions for n and being a difference of two perfect squares, it would make sense to test some values around those ranges.\n\n## Step 7: Testing these possible unit digits for M, let's see if any perfect squares in the given range meet the criteria.\nM must be an integer such that both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares. We need to test all the unit digit options.\n\n## Step 8: Finding a possible solution\nAfter testing these possibilities, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.\n\n## Step 9: Finding the unit digit of M.\nThe unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
