Question 2/20 (ID: 2):
Q: A model used to estimate the time it will take to hike to the top of the mountain on a trail is of the form T = aL + bG, where a and b are constants, T is the time in minutes, L is the length of the trail in miles, and G is the altitude gain in feet. The model estimates that it will take 69 minutes to hike to the top if a trail is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, as well as if a trail is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet. How many minutes does the model estimates it will take to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the values of constants a and b. We can do this by setting up two equations using the given information:

For the first hike: T = aL + bG => 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   For the second hike: T = aL + bG => T2 = a(1.2) + b(1100)

2. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

T2 - 69 = a(1.2) + b(1100) - a(1.5) - b(800) => T2 - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300)

3. Let's denote T2 as X (it's just for simplicity). So, we have:

X - 69 = a(-0.3) + b(300) ...(Equation 1)
   And from the first equation we have:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) ...(Equation 2)

4. Now, we can solve these two equations for a and b. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.5 and Equation 2 by -0.3:

1.5X - 69*1.5 = a(-0.3 * 1.5) + b(300 * 1.5) => 1.5X - 103.5 = a(-0.45) + b(450) ...(Equation 3)
   And from Equation 2 we have:
   -0.3*69 = a(1.5 * -0.3) + b(800 * -0.3) => -20.7 = a(-0.45) + b(-240) ...(Equation 4)

5. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   1.5X - 103.5 - 20.7 = 0 => 1.5X = 124.2 => X = $89.467$ (approximately)

6. Now that we have the value of T2, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a and b. Let's use Equation 2:
   69 = a(1.5) + b(800) => 69 - 1.5a = 800b => a/b = (800b)/(69-1.5a)
   But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that T2 is actually approximately 90 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   90 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 90 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(90-1.2a)
   Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (90-1.2a)
   Solving this equation gives us:
   a = $0.056$, b = $0.078$

7. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   T = aL + bG => T = 0.056*4.2 + 0.078*4000 => T = $312$ minutes (approximately)

So, the model estimates that it will take approximately \boxed{312} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.

1. We start with the given information about two scenarios:
   - For a trail that is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, it takes 69 minutes (T = a(1.5) + b(800)).
   - For a trail that is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet, the time T is unknown but let's denote it as X (T = a(1.2) + b(1100)).

2. We can set up two equations based on this information:
   - Equation 1: 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   - Equation 2: X = a(1.2) + b(1100)

3. To eliminate the variables a and b, we can manipulate these equations. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.2 and Equation 2 by -1.5:
   - 76.8 = a(1.8) + b(960) ...(Equation 3)
   - -1.5X = a(-1.8) + b(-1650) ...(Equation 4)

4. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   76.8 - 1.5X = 0 => X = $51.2$ minutes (approximately).

5. Now, we can substitute the value of X back into Equation 2 to find a and b:
   - 51.2 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51.2 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51.2-1.2a).
   - But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that X is actually approximately 51 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   51 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51-1.2a).
   - Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (51-1.2a).
   - Solving this equation gives us:
     a = $0.1$, b = $0.05$.

6. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   - T = aL + bG => T = 0.1*4.2 + 0.05*4000 => T = $236$ minutes (approximately).

So, the model estimates that it will take approximately \boxed{236} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.
Answer: 1. We start with the given information about two scenarios:
   - For a trail that is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, it takes 69 minutes (T = a(1.5) + b(800)).
   - For a trail that is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet, the time T is unknown but let's denote it as X (T = a(1.2) + b(1100)).

2. We can set up two equations based on this information:
   - Equation 1: 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)
   - Equation 2: X = a(1.2) + b(1100)

3. To eliminate the variables a and b, we can manipulate these equations. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.2 and Equation 2 by -1.5:
   - 76.8 = a(1.8) + b(960) ...(Equation 3)
   - -1.5X = a(-1.8) + b(-1650) ...(Equation 4)

4. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:
   76.8 - 1.5X = 0 => X = $51.2$ minutes (approximately).

5. Now, we can substitute the value of X back into Equation 2 to find a and b:
   - 51.2 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51.2 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51.2-1.2a).
   - But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that X is actually approximately 51 minutes (as given in the options). So:
   51 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51-1.2a).
   - Now we have two equations for a/b:
   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (51-1.2a).
   - Solving this equation gives us:
     a = $0.1$, b = $0.05$.

6. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:
   - T = aL + bG => T = 0.1*4.2 + 0.05*4000 => T = $236$ minutes (approximately).

Question 3/20 (ID: 3):
Q: What is the sum of the digits of the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand what a "prime" number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Next, let's find the smallest prime number that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes. The smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
3. If we add up these first five primes (2+3+5+7+11), we get 28. However, 28 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (it can be divided by 4).
4. So, we need to find another combination of five distinct primes that sum up to a prime number. The next possible combination is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. But again, 49 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 7.
5. Continuing this process, we eventually find the combination (2+3+5+11+17), which sums up to 38. This is still not a prime number.
6. Finally, we reach the combination (2+3+5+11+19), which sums up to 40. This is also not a prime number.
7. Moving on, we try (2+3+5+17+19), which sums up to 46. Again, this is not a prime number.
8. The next combination we try is (3+5+7+11+13), which sums up to 49. This is also not a prime number.
9. We continue this process until we find the combination (2+3+5+11+23), which sums up to 44. Again, this is not a prime number.
10. Finally, we reach the combination (3+5+7+13+17), which sums up to 45. This is also not a prime number.
11. We continue this process until we find that no other combination of five distinct primes will sum up to a prime number. Therefore, the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes does not exist.

Question 4/20 (ID: 4):
Q: The number 2024 is written as the sum of not necessarily distinct two-digit numbers. What is the least number of two-digit numbers needed to write this sum?

Using exemplars:
1. Start by identifying that we need to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers, where these numbers may repeat.
2. The maximum value for each two-digit number is 99, so the minimum number of such numbers needed can be found by dividing 2024 by 99 and rounding up since we are dealing with integers: 
   \[
   \frac{2024}{99} \approx 20.44 \Rightarrow 21
   \]
3. To confirm if 21 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024, consider using the highest possible value for each, which is 99:
   \[
   21 \times 99 = 2079
   \]
   This exceeds 2024. Therefore, we need more than 21 numbers, but let's check if 22 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.
4. If each number was 99, the sum would be:
   \[
   22 \times 99 = 2178
   \]
   We now reduce values of some numbers below 99 to achieve the exact sum of 2024. For example, setting two numbers to 52 instead of 99 gives us:
   \[
   20 \times 99 + 2 \times 52 = 1980 + 104 = 2084
   \]
   This is still too high. Instead, using the strategy of replacing two numbers with lower values might work better. Let's consider reducing two pairs:
   
   - Replace the first pair (99, 99) with (52, 52):
     \[
     1980 + 4 = 1984 \quad (\text{closer but still high})
     \]
   - Now replace another pair with (52, 52), we get:
     \[
     1984 + 4 = 2024 \quad (\text{exact sum achieved})
     \]
   
   The above strategy works, and indeed, 20 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.

Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{20}

Q: What is the minimum number of successive swaps of adjacent letters in the string ABCDEF that are needed to change the string to FEDCBA?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's understand the problem. We need to rearrange the string ABCDEF into FEDCBA using swaps of adjacent letters. The goal is to find the minimum number of such swaps.
2. To solve this, we can visualize the problem as a graph where each letter is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are adjacent in the string and can be swapped.
3. We can start by looking at the first and last letters (A and F). Since they are not adjacent, we need to swap them with other letters. The closest non-adjacent letter to A is D, so we swap A and D, making the string BCDFA.
4. Now, let's look at the new first and last letters (B and F). They are still not adjacent, but we can swap F and C to get BCADF.
5. Finally, we can swap A and D again to get the desired string FEDCBA.
6. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required is 3.

Question 7/20 (ID: 7):
Q: The product of three integers is 60. What is the least possible positive sum of the three integers?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the factors of 60 that could potentially be the three integers. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

2. To minimize the sum of these integers, we should choose the smallest possible factors that multiply to give 60. The smallest possible set of three factors is 1, 2, and 30 because their product is 60 (1 * 2 * 30 = 60) and their sum is the smallest among all possible combinations of factors.

3. So, the least possible positive sum of the three integers is 1 + 2 + 30 = 33.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{33}.

Question 8/20 (ID: 8):
Q: Amy, Bomani, Charlie, and Daria work in a chocolate factory. On Monday Amy, Bomani, and Charlie started working at 1:00 PM and were able to pack 4, 3, and 3 packages, respectively, every 3 minutes. At some later time, Daria joined the group, and Daria was able to pack 5 packages every 4 minutes. Together, they finished packing 450 packages at exactly 2:45 PM. At what time did Daria join the group?

Using exemplars:
1. First, let's find out how many packages Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed together before Daria joined them. They worked for 45 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 2:45 PM).

Amy packs 4 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, she would have packed $4 \times (45/3) = 60$ packages.
Bomani packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.
Charlie also packs 3 packages every 3 minutes, so in 45 minutes, he would have packed $3 \times (45/3) = 45$ packages.

2. Together, Amy, Bomani, and Charlie packed $60 + 45 + 45 = 150$ packages before Daria joined them.

3. Now let's find out when Daria started working. We know that after she joined, they finished packing the remaining 450 - 150 = 300 packages.

4. Daria packs 5 packages every 4 minutes, so to pack 300 packages, it would take her $300 / 5 = 60$ minutes. Since they finished packing at 2:45 PM, Daria must have joined them 1 hour before this time, which is at 1:45 PM.

Therefore, $$ \boxed{1:45} $$ was the time when Daria joined the group.

Question 9/20 (ID: 9):
Q: In how many ways can 6 juniors and 6 seniors form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to select 2 juniors out of 6 for the first team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
2. After selecting 2 juniors for the first team, we have 4 juniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 6 for the second team. The number of ways to do this is also given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 6 is C(6, 2).
3. Now, we have 4 juniors and 4 seniors left. We need to select 2 juniors out of 4 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 juniors out of 4 is C(4, 2).
4. Similarly, we have 2 seniors left. We need to select 2 seniors out of 2 for the third team. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula. So, the number of ways to choose 2 seniors out of 2 is C(2, 2).
5. Finally, we multiply all these combinations together to get the total number of ways to form 3 disjoint teams of people so that each team has 2 juniors and 2 seniors.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{C(6, 2) * C(6, 2) * C(4, 2) * C(2, 2)} $$

Question 10/20 (ID: 10):
Q: Consider the following operation. Given a positive integer n, if n is a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n/3. If n is not a multiple of 3, then you replace n by n+10. Then continue this process. Suppose you start with n=100. What value results if you perform this operation exactly 100 times?

Using exemplars:
1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.
2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110 + 10 = 120.
3. Continue this process:
   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 120 + 10 = 130.
   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130 + 10 = 140.
   - n = 140 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140 + 10 = 150.
   - n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.
4. Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.
5. Continue this process:
   - n = 60 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
6. Now n = 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.
7. Continue this process:
   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.
   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
8. We can see that the operation will keep oscillating between 10 and 30, but since the question asks for the result after exactly 100 operations, we need to continue this process for 100 times. However, it's clear that the operation will always result in either 10 or 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division).
9. Since the operation is performed an even number of times (100), the final result will be determined by whether we end up with n = 10 or n = 30 after the first 98 operations. This depends on the remainder when dividing 98 by 2 (since the pattern repeats every two operations).
10. The remainder when dividing 98 by 2 is 0, which means we will end up with n = 30 after the first 98 operations. Then, in the last two operations, we perform one addition and one division:
    - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.
    - n = 10 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.

The final answer is \boxed{20}.

Question 11/20 (ID: 11):
Q: How many ordered pairs of integers (m, n) satisfy sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m?

Using exemplars:
1. We start with the equation sqrt(n^2 - 49) = m.

2. Since m is an integer, it means that n^2 - 49 must be a perfect square. Let's denote this perfect square as k^2. So, we have n^2 - 49 = k^2.

3. Rearranging the equation gives us n^2 = k^2 + 49, or (n-k)(n+k) = 49.

4. The factors of 49 are ±1, ±7, and ±49. So, we have six possible pairs for (n-k, n+k): (1, 49), (-1, -49), (7, 42), (-7, -42), (49, 1), and (-49, -1).

5. For each pair of (n-k, n+k), we can solve for n and m:
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (1, 49), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-1, -49), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (7, 42), then n = 24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-7, -42), then n = -24.5 and m is not an integer, so this pair doesn't work.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (49, 1), then n = 25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.
   - If (n-k, n+k) = (-49, -1), then n = -25 and m = sqrt(625) = 25.

6. So, there are four ordered pairs of integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation: (25, 25), (25, -25), (-25, 25), and (-25, -25).

Question 12/20 (ID: 12):
Q: Of the 6 pairs of distinct transformations from this list (translation 2 units right, 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin, reflection across x-axis, dilation at origin with scale factor 2), how many commute?

Using exemplars:
1. A transformation commutes if it doesn't matter in which order you apply the transformations. This means that applying transformation T followed by transformation R should yield the same result as applying transformation R followed by transformation T.
2. Translation 2 units right is a linear transformation, and it does not affect the other transformations (since translation is an isometry). Therefore, it can commute with all transformations.
3. 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin: This transformation commutes with reflection across x-axis because a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection is equivalent to a reflection across the y-axis, and vice versa. However, it does not commute with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling.
4. Reflection across x-axis: This transformation commutes with 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin (as mentioned in step 3). It also commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because reflecting followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by reflecting.
5. Dilation at origin with scale factor 2: This transformation does not commute with any other transformations on this list, as scaling affects the outcome of the other transformations (translation and rotation).
6. Based on our analysis, only three pairs of distinct transformations commute (translation with reflection, translation with dilation, and reflection with 90-degree rotation). The final answer is $ \boxed{3} $.

1. First, let's identify the pairs of transformations that are being considered: (Translation, Rotation), (Translation, Reflection), (Translation, Dilation), (Rotation, Reflection), (Rotation, Dilation), and (Reflection, Dilation).

2. Now, we need to determine which pairs commute. Two transformations commute if the order in which they are applied does not affect the final result.

3. For the pair (Translation, Rotation), translation 2 units right is a linear transformation that doesn't affect the other transformations. However, it doesn't commute with rotation because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling. So, this pair does not commute.

4. For the pair (Translation, Reflection), translation 2 units right is a linear transformation that doesn't affect the other transformations. It commutes with reflection across x-axis because reflecting followed by translating would result in the same effect as translating followed by reflecting. So, this pair commutes.

5. For the pair (Translation, Dilation), translation 2 units right is a linear transformation that doesn't affect the other transformations. It commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because translating followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by translating. So, this pair commutes.

6. For the pair (Rotation, Reflection), a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin commutes with reflection across x-axis because reflecting followed by rotating would result in the same effect as rotating followed by reflecting. So, this pair commutes.

7. For the pair (Rotation, Dilation), a 90-degree rotation counterclockwise about origin does not commute with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because scaling followed by rotation would result in different effects than rotating followed by scaling. So, this pair does not commute.

8. For the pair (Reflection, Dilation), reflection across x-axis commutes with dilation at origin with scale factor 2 because reflecting followed by scaling would result in the same effect as scaling followed by reflecting. So, this pair commutes.

9. Therefore, out of the 6 pairs, only three pairs of distinct transformations commute: (Translation, Reflection), (Translation, Dilation), and (Reflection, Dilation). The final answer is $$ \boxed{3} $$.

Question 13/20 (ID: 13):
Q: Let M be the greatest integer such that both M + 1213 and M + 3773 are perfect squares. What is the unit digit of M?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to find the range in which our number M lies. Since both M+1213 and M+3773 are perfect squares, their difference (which is 2560) must be a multiple of some integer n, where n is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares.

2. The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference: sqrt(2560/2) = 41 (since 41*41 = 1681 and 42*42 = 1764, which are both greater than our range).

3. Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over: (sqrt(1213)-41)^2 < M < (sqrt(3773)-41)^2 => 904 < M < 2560.

4. Since we're looking for the unit digit of M, we can narrow down our search to numbers between 904 and 2560 with specific unit digits. The possible units digits for perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

5. Testing these values, we find that M = 1729 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 1729 + 1213 = 2942 = 54^2 and 1729 + 3773 = 5502 = 74^2.

6. The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 1729, which is 9.

Final answer: $$\boxed{9}$$

2. The smallest possible value for n can be found by taking the square root of half the difference: sqrt(2560/2) = 41 (since 41*41 = 1681 and 42*42 = 1764, which are both greater than our range).

3. Now we know that M must be between the perfect square closest to 1213 and the one closest to 3773 without going over: (sqrt(1213)-41)^2 < M < (sqrt(3773)-41)^2 => 904 < M < 2560.

4. Since we're looking for the unit digit of M, we can narrow down our search to numbers between 904 and 2560 with specific unit digits. The possible units digits for perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

5. Testing these values, we find that M = 2387 works since both (M + 1213) and (M + 3773) are perfect squares: 2387 + 1213 = 3600 = 60^2 and 2387 + 3773 = 6160 = 78^2.

6. The unit digit of M is therefore the same as the unit digit of 2387, which is 7.

Question 14/20 (ID: 14):
Q: For a two-out-of-three playoff with Team A having 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away, if Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, and p = 1/2 * (m - sqrt(n)) where m,n are positive integers, what is m + n?

Using exemplars:
1. Team A has a 2/3 chance of winning at home and p chance away. Since it's a two-out-of-three playoff, we need to consider the scenarios where Team A wins exactly two games out of three.

2. There are two possible ways for Team A to win two games:
   a) Win both games at home (2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9 chance).
   b) Win one game at home and one game away ((2/3)*p + (1-2/3)*(1-p)).

3. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2, so we can set up an equation: 4/9 + (2/3)*p + (1/3)*(1-p) = 1/2.

4. Solving this equation for p gives us: p = 1/6 * (m - sqrt(n)).

5. Since m and n are positive integers, we can find possible values by trial and error. One such solution is m=5 and n=4.

Final answer: $$ \boxed{5+4=9} $$

1. We know that Team A's overall probability of winning is 1/2. So we can set up an equation: 4/9 + (2/3)*p + (1/3)*(1-p) = 1/2.

2. Simplify the equation: (4/9) + (2/3)*p + (1/3) - (1/3)*p = 1/2.

3. Combine like terms: (4/9) + (1/3) - (1/3)*p = 1/2 - (2/3)*p.

4. Subtract (4/9) and (1/3) from both sides: -(1/3)*p = 1/6 - (1/6)*p.

5. Multiply all terms by -6 to get rid of the fractions: p = 2 - sqrt(m).

6. Since m and n are positive integers, we can find possible values by trial and error. One such solution is m=1 and n=0.

Question 15/20 (ID: 15):
Q: There are exactly K positive integers b with 5 <= b <= 2024 such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16. What is the sum of the digits of K?

Using exemplars:
1. A number is divisible by 16 if its last two digits are divisible by 16. This means that we need to find all base-b integers from 5 to 2024 (inclusive) such that the last two digits of their decimal representation are divisible by 16.
2. Since there is only one digit position in the range [5, 2024], we only need to check if each number in this range has a last digit that is divisible by 16.
3. We can start by listing all numbers from 5 to 2024 and checking their last digits:
   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (which is divisible by 16), 17, ..., 2024.
4. We can see that every 16th number from the right has a last digit that is divisible by 16. Therefore, we need to count how many numbers in this range satisfy this condition.
5. To do this, we can divide the difference between the largest and smallest numbers (2024 - 5) by 16 and round up to the nearest integer: (2024 - 5) / 16 = 126.4375, which rounds up to 127.
6. Therefore, there are K = 127 positive integers b such that the base-b integer 2024b is divisible by 16.
7. Finally, we need to find the sum of the digits of K:
   1 + 2 + 7 = 10.
8. The final answer is $ \boxed{10} $.

Question 16/20 (ID: 16):
Q: The first three terms of a geometric sequence are the integers a, 720 and b, where a < 720 < b. What is the sum of the digits of the least possible value of b?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given that `a`, `720`, and `b` form a geometric sequence with `a < 720 < b`. We need to find the sum of digits of the least possible value of `b`.
   
2. **Finding `a`**: Since the terms form a geometric progression, we have:
   \[
   \frac{720}{a} = r \quad \text{(common ratio)}
   \]
   Given that `a < 720`, and to maximize `a` (minimize the common ratio), we choose the largest integer factor of `720` less than `720`. The prime factorization of `720` is:
   \[
   720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5
   \]
   Thus, the largest divisor less than `720` but greater than `1` is `80` (since `90 > 720`). So:
   \[
   a = \frac{720}{9} = 80 \quad \text{(not valid, as 80 < 720)}
   \]
   Correcting the mistake, we should choose \( a = 45 \) instead (as it is the largest integer factor less than 720 that also results in a geometric sequence).

3. **Finding `b`**: Now that we have `a = 45`, then:
   \[
   b = 720 \times r = 720 \times \frac{720}{45}
   \]
   Simplifying further, we find:
   \[
   b = 720 \times \frac{16}{1} = 9600
   \]

4. **Sum of Digits**: The digits in `b` are `9`, `6`, `0`, and `0`. Summing these gives:
   \[
   9 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 15
   \]

### Conclusion:
The sum of the digits of the least possible value of `b` is $\boxed{15}$.

1. We need to find an integer `a` such that `a < 720` and forms a geometric sequence with `720`. The common ratio `r` must be an integer greater than `1` because the terms of the geometric progression are integers, and `b = 720 \times r`.

2. Since we want to find the smallest possible value for `b`, we need to choose the largest possible value for `a`. The largest integer factor of `720` less than `720` is `80` (since `90 > 720`). However, if we choose \( a = 80 \), then the common ratio would be:
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{80} = 9
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 9 = 6480 \), which is not valid because `b` should be less than `720`.
   
3. The next largest integer factor of `720` that can work for `a` is `45`. If we choose \( a = 45 \), then:
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{45} = 16
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 16 = 11520 \). But this value for `b` is still not valid because it's greater than `720`.
   
4. To find the correct `a`, we need to look for a common ratio less than `16` that still results in an integer value for `b`. Consider \( a = 8 \), then:
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{8} = 90
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 90 = 64800 \). This is also not valid as `b` should be less than `720`.
   
5. Finally, consider \( a = 12 \), then:
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{12} = 60
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 60 = 43200 \). This value for `b` is greater than `720`, so it's not valid.
   
6. Let's try \( a = 15 \):
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{15} = 48
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 48 = 34560 \). This value for `b` is greater than `720`, so it's not valid.
   
7. The only value that satisfies the condition `a < 720 < b` and results in an integer value for `b` is when \( a = 90 \):
   \[
   r = \frac{720}{90} = 8
   \]
   and thus \( b = 720 \times 8 = 5760 \). The digits of `b` are `5`, `7`, `6`, `0`, and the sum is:

   5 + 7 + 6 + 0 = 18

Question 17/20 (ID: 17):
Q: Let S be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 2024} such that for distinct elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 2, and for distinct odd elements x,y in S: |x-y| > 6. What is the maximum possible number of elements in S?

Using exemplars:
1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The set \( S \) is a subset of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \).
   - For distinct elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 2 \).
   - For distinct odd elements \( x, y \in S \), \( |x-y| > 6 \).

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers:**
   - The odd numbers in the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, 2024\} \) are:
     \[
     1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2023
     \]
   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \), common difference \( d = 2 \), and last term \( l = 2023 \).

3. **Calculating the Number of Odd Numbers:**
   - The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a + (n-1)d
     \]
     Setting \( a_n = 2023 \):
     \[
     2023 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     2022 = (n-1) \cdot 2 \implies n-1 = 1011 \implies n = 1012
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 1012 odd numbers in the set.

4. **Applying the Odd Number Constraint:**
   - Since the difference between any two distinct odd elements must be greater than 6, we can select every 7th odd number to maximize the count:
     \[
     1, 7, 13, \ldots, 2015
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1012}{7} = 144 \) terms.

5. **Applying the Even Number Constraint:**
   - For even numbers, the difference must be greater than 2. We can select every 3rd even number:
     \[
     2, 5, 8, \ldots, 2022
     \]
   - This sequence has \( \frac{1011}{3} = 337 \) terms.

6. **Combining the Counts:**
   - The total number of elements in \( S \) is the sum of the odd and even counts:
     \[
     144 + 337 = 481
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum possible number of elements in \( S \) is \( \boxed{481} \).

Q: Integers a, b, and c satisfy ab + c = 10, bc + a = 87, and ca + b = 60. What is ab + bc + ca?

Using exemplars:
1. We are given three equations involving integers a, b, and c:
   - ab + c = 10
   - bc + a = 87
   - ca + b = 60

2. Adding these three equations together gives us the sum of all products of two different numbers from a, b, and c, plus an extra copy of each number:
   - (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 10 + 87 + 60
   - ab + bc + ca + c + a + b = 157

3. We want to find the value of ab + bc + ca, but we have an extra term with c + a + b. However, since we know that (ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ca + b) = 157, and each number appears exactly once in each equation, then:
   - c + a + b = ab + bc + ca

4. Now, let's subtract the extra term from our previous sum:
   - (ab + bc + ca + c + a + b) - (c + a + b) = 157 - (c + a + b)
   - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 157

5. To find the value of ab + bc + ca, we can divide both sides by 2:

Question 19/20 (ID: 19):
Q: A bee moves in 3D space based on die rolls (A+/A- for x, B+/B- for y, C+/C- for z). Starting at origin with 4 rolls, what's the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges of a unit cube?

Using exemplars:
1. First, we need to understand that a die roll can result in any number from 1 to 6 (since it's not specified otherwise). However, in the context of this problem, each roll represents a step along the x, y, or z axis of a unit cube. So, we are only interested in whether a roll results in a positive (+) or negative (-) step.
2. For the bee to traverse 4 distinct edges of a unit cube starting from the origin and moving in 3D space based on die rolls, it means that each axis (x, y, z) should have at least one positive and one negative step. The order of these steps doesn't matter.
3. Now, let's calculate the probability of this happening:
   a. Probability of rolling a positive or negative step on any axis is 1/2 (since there are two outcomes - + and -).
   b. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities for each axis to get the overall probability.
4. Therefore, the probability of traversing 4 distinct edges is:
$$ \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} $$

Question 20/20 (ID: 20):
Q: In a line of people, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. How many people are in the line?

Using exemplars:
1. Let's denote the total number of people in the line as N.
2. According to the problem, the 1013th person from the left is also the 1010th person from the right. This means that there are 1012 people between this person and the end of the line (since the last person isn't counted twice).
3. Therefore, we can write the equation: N = 1013 + 1012.
4. Solving for N gives us N = 2025.

The final answer is: $$ \boxed{2025} $$

  "1. We start with the given information about two scenarios:\n   - For a trail that is 1.5 miles long and ascends 800 feet, it takes 69 minutes (T = a(1.5) + b(800)).\n   - For a trail that is 1.2 miles long and ascends 1100 feet, the time T is unknown but let's denote it as X (T = a(1.2) + b(1100)).\n\n2. We can set up two equations based on this information:\n   - Equation 1: 69 = a(1.5) + b(800)\n   - Equation 2: X = a(1.2) + b(1100)\n\n3. To eliminate the variables a and b, we can manipulate these equations. Multiply Equation 1 by 1.2 and Equation 2 by -1.5:\n   - 76.8 = a(1.8) + b(960) ...(Equation 3)\n   - -1.5X = a(-1.8) + b(-1650) ...(Equation 4)\n\n4. Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 gives us:\n   76.8 - 1.5X = 0 => X = $51.2$ minutes (approximately).\n\n5. Now, we can substitute the value of X back into Equation 2 to find a and b:\n   - 51.2 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51.2 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51.2-1.2a).\n   - But since we don't know the exact values of a and b, let's assume that X is actually approximately 51 minutes (as given in the options). So:\n   51 = a(1.2) + b(1100) => 51 - 1.2a = 1100b => a/b = (1100b)/(51-1.2a).\n   - Now we have two equations for a/b:\n   800b / (69-1.5a) = 1100b / (51-1.2a).\n   - Solving this equation gives us:\n     a = $0.1$, b = $0.05$.\n\n6. Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b into the original equation to find the time it takes to hike 4.2 miles with an altitude gain of 4000 feet:\n   - T = aL + bG => T = 0.1*4.2 + 0.05*4000 => T = $236$ minutes (approximately).\n\nSo, the model estimates that it will take approximately \\boxed{236} minutes to hike to the top if the trail is 4.2 miles long and ascends 4000 feet.",
  "1. We start by considering the smallest prime numbers, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...\n2. We need to find a combination of five distinct primes that sum up to a prime number. Let's start with the first five primes: 2+3+5+7+11 = 28. However, 28 is not a prime number.\n3. We continue this process and eventually find the combination (2+3+5+19+23), which sums up to 52. This is also not a prime number.\n4. The next combination we try is (3+5+7+11+23), which sums up to 59. We can check that 59 is indeed a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n5. Therefore, the smallest prime that can be written as a sum of 5 distinct primes is 59.\n6. The sum of the digits of 59 is $5 + 9 = 14$.",
  "1. Start by identifying that we need to express 2024 as a sum of two-digit numbers, where these numbers may repeat.\n2. The maximum value for each two-digit number is 99, so the minimum number of such numbers needed can be found by dividing 2024 by 99 and rounding up since we are dealing with integers:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2024}{99} \\approx 20.44 \\Rightarrow 21\n   \\]\n3. To confirm if 21 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024, consider using the highest possible value for each, which is 99:\n   \\[\n   21 \\times 99 = 2079\n   \\]\n   This exceeds 2024. Therefore, we need more than 21 numbers, but let's check if 22 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.\n4. If each number was 99, the sum would be:\n   \\[\n   22 \\times 99 = 2178\n   \\]\n   We now reduce values of some numbers below 99 to achieve the exact sum of 2024. For example, setting two numbers to 52 instead of 99 gives us:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 99 + 2 \\times 52 = 1980 + 104 = 2084\n   \\]\n   This is still too high. Instead, using the strategy of replacing two numbers with lower values might work better. Let's consider reducing two pairs:\n   \n   - Replace the first pair (99, 99) with (52, 52):\n     \\[\n     1980 + 4 = 1984 \\quad (\\text{closer but still high})\n     \\]\n   - Now replace another pair with (52, 52), we get:\n     \\[\n     1984 + 4 = 2024 \\quad (\\text{exact sum achieved})\n     \\]\n   \n   The above strategy works, and indeed, 20 two-digit numbers can sum to 2024.\n\nConclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",
  "1. First, let's factorize 2024 into its prime factors. 2024 = 2^3 * 7 * 11\n2. For n! to be a multiple of 2024, it must contain at least three factors of 2 (because 2024 has three factors of 2), one factor of 7, and one factor of 11.\n3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is when n = 11, because 11! will contain all the necessary factors: three factors of 2 (from 2, 4, and 8), one factor of 7 (from 7), and one factor of 11 (from 11).\n4. Therefore, the least value of n such that n! is a multiple of 2024 is \\boxed{11}",

  '1. First, we need to find the factors of 60 that could potentially be the three integers. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.\n\n2. To minimize the sum of these integers, we should choose the smallest possible factors that multiply to give 60. The smallest possible set of three factors is 1, 2, and 30 because their product is 60 (1 * 2 * 30 = 60) and their sum is the smallest among all possible combinations of factors.\n\n3.

  "1. Start with n = 100, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110.\n2. Now n = 110, which is also not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 110 + 10 = 120.\n3. Continue this process:\n   - n = 120 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 120 + 10 = 130.\n   - n = 130 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 130 + 10 = 140.\n   - n = 140 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 140 + 10 = 150.\n   - n = 150 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50.\n4. Now n = 50, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60.\n5. Continue this process:\n   - n = 60 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.\n   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.\n   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.\n6. Now n = 10, which is not a multiple of 3, so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.\n7. Continue this process:\n   - n = 20 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.\n   - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.\n8. We can see that the operation will keep oscillating between 10 and 30, but since the question asks for the result after exactly 100 operations, we need to continue this process for 100 times. However, it's clear that the operation will always result in either 10 or 30 after each pair of operations (one addition and one division).\n9. Since the operation is performed an even number of times (100), the final result will be determined by whether we end up with n = 10 or n = 30 after the first 98 operations. This depends on the remainder when dividing 98 by 2 (since the pattern repeats every two operations).\n10. The remainder when dividing 98 by 2 is 0, which means we will end up with n = 30 after the first 98 operations. Then, in the last two operations, we perform one addition and one division:\n    - n = 30 (a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n / 3 = 30 / 3 = 10.\n    - n = 10 (not a multiple of 3), so we replace it with n + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{20}.",
